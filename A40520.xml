            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Good Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT will ſuffice that I ſuggeſt unto thee theſe <hi>Two</hi> things on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> That the <hi>Author</hi> of theſe enſuing <hi>Sermons</hi> was a <hi>Great man</hi> for <hi>Worth</hi> in his Generation. <hi>Great</hi> for <hi>true Holineſs</hi> both in <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> Though a perſon of a pleaſant converſation, yet made great conſcience of touching the leaſt ſin. He had a truly tender Conſcience, and withall led a moſt blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life. 2. He was <hi>great</hi> in <hi>Parts,</hi> both <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;</hi> a River of Eloquence did always flow from him, and that without any affectation. He had concocted the ſubſtance of <hi>School-Divinity,</hi> and made it uſeful for his Miniſtry. He was a good <hi>Textuary,</hi> and well acquainted with the <hi>Learned Languages.</hi> He had the command of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and other Juvenile <hi>Learning,</hi> even in his Old Age, and made a ſober and ſweet uſe of them in his Miniſtration. 3. He was <hi>great</hi> in his <hi>Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Of a ſweet and ſociable <hi>temper;</hi> ever cheerful, unleſs clouded with the fears of <hi>Gods</hi> Diſpleaſure: Of a gentile and obliging <hi>humour,</hi> fit to converſe with the Greateſt, and yet ready to reſolve the Caſes, and comfort the hearts of the Meaneſt. No man at once more <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> and yet Humble: It was as rare a thing to hear him ſpeak ill of any man, as it was to hear any man ſpeak
<pb facs="tcp:55699:4"/> all of him. 4. He was <hi>great</hi> in his <hi>Labours,</hi> both in his <hi>Study,</hi> in his <hi>Family,</hi> and in the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> He dwelt in his <hi>Study,</hi> it was his Palace; his book and he ſeldom parted, except at meals, throughout the whole day, unleſs it were to lay out in his Maſters ſervice, what he had been laying in; (and ſo <hi>intent</hi> in it, that it was long before he did hear or heed ſuch as were ſent to call him down: And the <hi>matter</hi> of his ſtudies would ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his heart, that he was frequently over-heard by his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks to perfume his Garden with holy <hi>Ejaculations.</hi> And then in his <hi>Family,</hi> he was diligent and ſerious, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Scriptures read, Pſalms ſung,</hi> and <hi>Prayers pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> out every day, and <hi>preaching</hi> to his houſhold two or three times in the weel (except in Harveſt) for a long time. He frequented the publick Ordinances when he was able, &amp; exacted a conſtant account of the proficience of his <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> under the Means of Grace; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, he ſeldom omitted a ſolemn <hi>Exhortation</hi> to them on <hi>Saturday</hi> Evening, the better to compoſe and prepare them for the Duties of the <hi>Lords-day.</hi> But he was <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> there his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Gifts</hi> did ſhine, like a Star of the <hi>firſt</hi> Magnitude. He did really ſeem to his Hearers to come there like an <hi>Angel</hi> dropt from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. His Eye, his Countenance, his Geſture proper to a Divine Orator. His <hi>Sermons</hi> compoſed of <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and delivered with ſuch natural <hi>fluency,</hi> and other gracious <hi>Accompliſhments,</hi> that his <hi>Elocution</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation</hi> did equally charm his Hearers; which he would frequently intermix with lively <hi>Apoſtrophes,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>God,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>them</hi> that were before him, in a moſt effectual manner. His <hi>Genius</hi> did moſt naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to deal with ungodly men by way of ſweet <hi>refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion</hi> and <hi>perſwaſion,</hi> yet upon occaſion he excelled in the <hi>penetrating</hi> and <hi>terrifying</hi> Hypocrites and obdurate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb facs="tcp:55699:4"/> and his <hi>ſword</hi> was the keener by being dipt in oyl. 5. He was <hi>great in ſucceſs:</hi> many in <hi>London,</hi> and more in the <hi>Country,</hi> ſome alive, and ſome dead, that received their ſpiritual life, growth, and comfort from God by his Miniſtry. 6. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He was <hi>great</hi> in his <hi>Afflictions</hi> and <hi>Tryals.</hi> He was reduced in his laſt years to a narrow <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood;</hi> Being no <hi>Plodder</hi> for Riches, nor <hi>Complainer</hi> of Poverty; he had ſcarce whereon to <hi>live,</hi> much leſs wherewith to <hi>give</hi> to <hi>ſix Children</hi> which ſurviv'd him. And to add to this Tryal, falling from his Horſe not long before his Death, he brake his <hi>Leg,</hi> which proved a long and ſore affliction; which ſad ſeaſon <hi>Satan</hi> eſpying, fell upon him with his black <hi>Tentations,</hi> with which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured many bitter Conflicts; and then he that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted many, had need of comfort himſelf; but <hi>Thanks be to God, who gave him the Victory through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> and releaſed him from his Warfare on Earth in the <hi>Sixty-third</hi> year of his life. The modeſty of his ſurviving <hi>Relations</hi> hinders you from a more particular <hi>Narrative</hi> of his Life, which was eminent and exemplary every way. When I have ſaid all, I ſpeak not in Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I do but darken his luſtre; He was a Man every way above my Commendation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> That theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> were exactly <hi>his own,</hi> being tranſcribed from his <hi>Notes</hi> with all poſſible care. Being Preach't in the <hi>Country,</hi> they were fitted for his <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> though you will find they might have gratified more diſcerning palates: You cannot expect them ſo exactly <hi>poliſht</hi> or <hi>methodiz'd</hi> as thoſe that came out of the <note n="*" place="margin">The Gale of Opportunity; and, The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> 
               <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> own hand, but they may prove as profitable to the <hi>honeſt and good heart,</hi> who will have occaſion to give thanks to that <hi>Worthy Perſon</hi> by whoſe <hi>direction</hi> theſe are publiſht; and to beg of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>thruſt</hi> more ſuch <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into his Harveſt.</hi> In a word, though it be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb facs="tcp:55699:5"/> to repreſent them to the <hi>eye</hi> with that peculiar <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> wherewith he did it to the <hi>ear,</hi> yet the <hi>ſerious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> will find herein that which will clear his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding, ſearch his Conſcience, inflame his Zeal, and ſettle his Comfort: which is the unfeined ſcope and deſire of</p>

                  <bibl>Mat. XIII. 11, 12.</bibl>
                  <p>He anſwered and ſaid unto them, Becauſe it is given unto you to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.</p>
                  <p>For whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Chapter is made up of <hi>Parables,</hi> with which Chriſt at this time <hi>Apparel'd</hi> his Sermon to the people: <hi>He ſpake ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things unto them in Parables,</hi> Ver. 3, at which his Diſciples wondred, and asked him, <hi>Why ſpeakeſt thou unto them in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> Ver. 10? <hi>i. e.</hi> Sir, the rude multitude do not underſtand thee, they cannot ſee the ſoul of thy meaning through the body of thy <hi>Parables:</hi> And therefore, <hi>Why ſpeakeſt thou unto them in Parables?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Diſciples wonder at it. Where obſerve an Example of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55699:6"/> Ignorance in the Diſciples, they knew not the cauſe why Chriſt ſpake in Parables to the multitude.</p>
            <p>Obſ. 1. <hi>Saints are ignorant of the Reaſon of Gods Actions, till he make it known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>We admire</hi> why <hi>God doth do many things, till he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the</hi> Reaſon.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Good hearers and Chriſtians are not aſhamed to profeſs and acknowledg their Ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Non Pudor eſt, Neſcire aliquid; ſed Diſcere Nolle</l>
               <l>Et Pudor &amp; Scelus eſt.—</l>
            </q>
            <p>4. <hi>The Saints are very deſirous to know the Reaſon of Chriſts Actions:</hi> Why ſpeakeſt thou unto them in Parables?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Beginnings of Grace and Knowledg are very earneſt after more: Good hearts are very Inquiſitive and diligent to ask and underſtand the Myſteries of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dub.</hi> 1. And indeed it is a wonder that Chriſt who loved ſouls ſo dearly, and thirſted after their Salvation, who was ſent into the world by his Father to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmask</hi> the way to Heaven; and who had before Explained the Law, and taken the <hi>Vizor</hi> off from the face of it, and convinced the Proud, and Preached ſo home to the heart, that he Preacht with Authority: He Preached plainly when he ſaid, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand:</hi> He preached plainly when he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. and now to cloathe his Sermons with ſuch dark Parables, it is a wonder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> To this the Lord Jeſus Anſwers, That he therefore preached in <hi>Parables: i. e.</hi> darkly and obſcurely, Becauſe he preached in <hi>Judgment</hi> unto ſome that were preſent: He preacht that they <hi>might not</hi> underſtand him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dub.</hi> 2. But why ſhould his Diſciples admire that he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>now</hi> in Parables, ſeeing it was <hi>always</hi> his cuſtom to do ſo?

            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> Chriſt was <hi>wont</hi> to preach in <hi>Parables,</hi> and therefore that is not the Diſciples <hi>Query,</hi> at leaſt not the <hi>meaning</hi> of it, why he did <hi>now</hi> uſe Parables (for he did ordinarily uſe them); but when he did uſe them, he did Explain them; <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 4-7. and 16. 1-8, 9.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55699:6"/>
            <p>But now Chriſt did preach in <hi>Parables,</hi> and <hi>not Explain</hi> them as he was wont to do.</p>
            <p>And before we leave this <hi>Query</hi> of the Diſciples, [<hi>Why ſpeakeſt thou unto them in Parables</hi>]? Obſerve further,</p>

            <p>1. Their <hi>Charity</hi> and love to the ſouls of others, <hi>Why ſpeakeſt thou</hi> [to them] <hi>in Parables?</hi> They underſtand thee not: they firſt ask Chriſt why he ſpake to them in <hi>Parables,</hi> before they ask him to Explain the <hi>Parables</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>Good hearts deſire the Salvation of others, as well as their own:</hi> aeque, <hi>though not</hi> aequaliter.</p>
            <p>2. Their <hi>Modeſty</hi> towards Chriſt: They do not queſtion Chriſt's <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or manner of Teaching in <hi>publick,</hi> but ask him in private to Explain himſelf, <hi>When he was alone,</hi> Mar. 4. 10. and Mat. 13. 36.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>People ought not to queſtion and move doubts againſt their Miniſters Doctrine in publick, but in private; leſt they ſhould by their importunity create ſtirs and tumult, and give to others occaſion of doing any thing unſeaſonably and out of due time: Therefore his Diſciples move queſtions in private.</hi>

            <p>2. From <hi>Ver.</hi> the <hi>10th,</hi> The Diſciples when they heard the <hi>Parable,</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Why ſpeakeſt thou unto them in Parables? i. e.</hi> Why doſt thou preach ſo Obſcurely and Aenigmatically to them? Why doſt thou not open thy ſelf more plainly to them? They are never the better for what thou ſaieſt; neither <hi>they</hi> nor <hi>we</hi> underſtand thy meaning: And therefore they without doubt<note place="margin">Mar. 4 10-13.</note> asked Chriſt in private to unlock the Cabinet of the <hi>Parable</hi> to them, and ſhew them the Jewel, or meaning of it: Now ſaith Chriſt, [<hi>to you, (i. e.</hi> Who deſire of me ſpiritual knowledg) <hi>it ſhall be given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>]

            </p>
            <p>3. Jeſus Chriſt in the <hi>13th Ver.</hi> gives his Diſciples an account why he ſpake to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in Parables, <hi>Becauſe they ſeeing, ſee not: i. e.</hi> They are wilfully blind, they ſee the wood, and yet will not ſee the trees: they ſee my <hi>Works,</hi> and yet will not ſee me to be <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In ſeeing they ſee not</hi>] i. e. <hi>They have ſeen me and believe not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 36.</note> They ſee <hi>me</hi> and my <hi>Miracles</hi> with the eye of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and yet will not ſee <hi>me</hi> with the eye of <hi>faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And hearing they hear not] i. e.</hi> They hear with the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Audientes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris ſenſu, non audiunt cordis aſſenſu.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</note> the ear, but hear not with the aſſent of the heart: they hear and are convinced, but will not be converted; as you have it in the <hi>15th Ver. They perceive, but will not receive the knowledg of the truth.</hi> For to <hi>hear,</hi> is to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>ſubmit</hi> to what we hear: It implies the <hi>affection</hi> with the <hi>Organ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in oppoſition to them, ſaith the Lord Chriſt to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Ver. 16, <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes for they ſee, and your ears for they hear:</hi> Your eyes ſee me, and are taken with the ſight of me; your eyes ſee me, and your hearts are in love with me: your ſight of me hath wounded you with the <hi>love of eſpouſals</hi> to me: And your ears hear and ſuck in the truths you hear from me. You hear and ſubmit to the Authority of the Word you hear from me: You ſee with an <hi>amorous eye,</hi> and you hear with a <hi>believing ear:</hi> And therefore <hi>to you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>it ſhall be given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given, i. e.</hi> It ſhall not be given: <hi>For whoſoever hath,</hi> (that is, whoſoever hath a Believing eye, and an Obediential ear) <hi>to him ſhall be given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And he ſhall have more abundance</hi> of knowledg and grace added to him.</p>
            <p>4. So that the ſenſe and mind of the Text is this: <hi>Whoſoever hath,</hi> by the gift of God, any true beams of Light, <hi>to him ſhall be given</hi> further Revelations: God will give him <hi>higher</hi> degrees. <hi>Whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given: i. e.</hi> He gives after he hath given: as a Spring runs when it hath run.</p>
            <p>So that the words ſpeak not a word of the Improvement of Nature, but of the gifts of Grace, both in the beginning and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55699:9"/> in the increaſe: <hi>Whoſoever hath,</hi> it is by gift; and whoſoever hath <hi>more,</hi> it is by further gift: So that this phraſe [<hi>whoſoever hath</hi>] ſpeaks a gift, in that he hath: <hi>For what hath any man</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>which he hath not received?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning is not then, <hi>whoſoever hath</hi> the improvement of Nature, <hi>to him</hi> ſhall be <hi>given</hi> true <hi>Grace;</hi> but <hi>whoſoever hath</hi> true <hi>Grace</hi> given to him, <hi>to him</hi> ſtill it ſhall be given, <hi>and he ſhall have more abundance:</hi> God will heap favours on them. <hi>i. e.</hi> The beginning of Grace is a pawn of <hi>more</hi> Grace, and every <hi>former</hi> Grace ſhall be a pledg of <hi>future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> God gives Grace, therefore we have it: <hi>whoſoever hath,</hi> then he adds more to it, <hi>to him it ſhall be given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The words are a Reaſon why Chriſt ſaid to the Apoſtles, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is given to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: For</hi> (or becauſe) <hi>whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given:</hi> I pray, mark it, I ſay, It is a Reaſon, not why <hi>natural</hi> men ſhould have Grace given them, but why the Diſciples ſhould have Grace given them.</p>
            <p>2. Having, or not having, is to be underſtood of Saving Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore ſpeak I in Parable to them, becauſe they ſeeing, ſee not: and hearing, they hear not, neither do they underſtand,</hi> Ver. 13. Here Chriſt gives the Reaſon clearly (which he toucht in Ver. 11, <hi>But to them it is not given</hi>) why he ſpake to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in Parables, becauſe hearing Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preach plainly the Kingdom of Heaven, they would not underſtand, nor believe, nor obey him: <hi>Hearing, they would not hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſeeing his <hi>Holineſs</hi> and his <hi>Miracles,</hi> they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nor receive him for the <hi>Meſſia:</hi> Thus <hi>ſeeing they would not ſee:</hi> And therefore they deſerved that Chriſt ſhould now preach in obſcure and cloudy Parables to them.</p>
            <p>We ſee then the cauſe of Chriſt's preaching in Parables, was the <hi>obſtinacy</hi> of ſome who were preſent; and they were not meer ſimple men, unlearnd men, but the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who follow Chriſt only to carp at, and catch him. (2) To deride him; and he was not to give holy things to <hi>Dogs:</hi> From <hi>theſe</hi> the myſteries of Heaven were juſtly vailed, becauſe in <hi>ſeeing</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> they did <hi>not,</hi> and would not <hi>ſee,</hi> nor <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>underſtand:</hi> Obſerve hence,</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:55699:9"/>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>Such minds as hearers bring to Chriſt, ſuch Sermons doth he preach to them.</hi>

            <p>Becauſe they <hi>would</hi> not underſtand, they <hi>ſhall</hi> not: When they will not underſtand thoſe things that are clear and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, Chriſt involves his ſpeeches in darkneſs; becauſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples do <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>honeſtly</hi> receive what is given, they are worthy, <hi>i. e.</hi> counted worthy, to whom more ſecret myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould be Communicated.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>As it is the mercy and gift of God, that ſome hear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what they hear; ſo it is the dreadful judgment of God, that ſome</hi> in hearing, hear not, nor underſtand.</p>
            <p>Having travel'd thus far in the Explanation of our Text, we now arrive at the ſeveral <hi>Theſes,</hi> or <hi>Doctrines</hi> contained in it; upon which we will lay the Structure of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>1. Doct. <hi>The matters of the Kingdom of Heaven are Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>It is a matchleſs aend bleſſed Priviledg to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Divine knowledg of the Myſteries of Heaven is given to ſome, not to others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Where there are beginnings of true Graece, though never ſo weak, God makes rich additions of more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe we will treat in order as they lye before us.</p>
            <p>1. Doct. <hi>The matters of the Kingdom of Heaven are Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is a great Myſtery: The <hi>Creator</hi> became a <hi>Creature:</hi> He who <hi>made Man,</hi> was made <hi>Man:</hi> He was <hi>born</hi> of the <hi>Virgin</hi>-Mother, and yet <hi>made</hi> his <hi>Mother:</hi> He that was the <hi>Father of Eternity,</hi> was <hi>born in time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He never <hi>offended</hi> his Father, and yet was the <hi>greateſt offender</hi> in the world: <hi>A ſinner,</hi> and <hi>no ſinner: For he knew no ſin,</hi> and yet <hi>was made ſin for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was <hi>David</hi>'s Son, and yet <hi>David</hi> called him <hi>Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 42, 43.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Juſtification</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt, is a great Myſtery.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Curſe</hi> denounced againſt them that break the <hi>Law:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> and yet the Saints are <hi>not curſed,</hi> though they never kept the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Saints <hi>cannot</hi> be Juſtified by the <hi>Law,</hi> and yet the <hi>Law</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 23.</note> 
               <hi>cannot but</hi> Juſtifie them.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55699:10"/>
            <p>There's nothing hinders Acceptance but <hi>Sin;</hi> yet <hi>Sin</hi> doth<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> not hinder their Acceptance.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Faith</hi> is a Myſtery. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Faith is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1.</note> [or <hi>ſubſiſtence] of things hoped for, and the Evidence of things not ſeen. See</hi> and not <hi>ſee;</hi> things not <hi>ſeen,</hi> and yet Faith <hi>ſees</hi> them; Things <hi>to come,</hi> and yet makes them <hi>preſent,</hi> and gives them <hi>preſent Being;</hi> It is a Myſtery: <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born ſome thouſand years after <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet <hi>Abraham ſaw</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 8. 56.</note> 
               <hi>his Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Faith</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaw him that is Inviſible,</hi> ſaith the Text: [<hi>Inviſible</hi>] and yet <hi>ſaw him,</hi> It is a Myſtery; He ſaw him by <hi>Faith,</hi> who could not be ſeen by <hi>Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, that againſt hope, he believed in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 18.</note> 
               <hi>hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Regeneration</hi> is a Myſtery: That a man ſhould be <hi>born again,</hi> and yet not enter <hi>into his Mothers Womb,</hi> it is a Myſtery: <hi>How can a man be born when he is old?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Nicodemus</hi>)<note place="margin">John 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Can he enter the ſecond time into his mothers Womb, and be born?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Converſion</hi> is a Myſtery; That a man ſhould be the <hi>ſame,</hi> and not the <hi>ſame;</hi> the ſame man for <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> and yet not the <hi>ſame</hi> in regard of ſupernatural Life and Being put into him; It is a Myſtery:</p>
            <p>To ſee a mans <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> turned backward; He that was <hi>proud</hi> before, now turned <hi>humble;</hi> and he that was <hi>ambitious</hi> before, now deſpiſe the <hi>vain</hi> World, it is a ſtrange Myſtery: The men of the World ſtand wondring at it (as<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 4.</note> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did at <hi>Saul: Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi>) And the Church admired at <hi>Paul.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 9. 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Humility</hi> is a Myſtery: The Saints know themſelves to be <hi>Kings,</hi> and yet refuſe not to be every mans <hi>Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To lye loweſt, is the only way to riſe higheſt: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall humble himſelf, the ſame is the greateſt in the Kingdom of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 4. Matth 23. 12. <hi>Auguſt. de Temp.</hi>

               <hi>heaven: But whoſoever doth exalt. himſelf, ſhall be abaſed. Videte magreum miraculum, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin;</hi> See here a great miracle; God is on <hi>high;</hi> and yet the <hi>higher</hi> thou lifteſt up thy ſelf, the further thou art from him; and the <hi>lower</hi> thou hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt thy ſelf, the <hi>nearer</hi> thou art to him.</p>
            <p>The Angels, thoſe <hi>great Courtiers</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of Heaven, ſuch is their humility, they become <hi>Miniſtring ſpirits</hi> to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55699:10"/> Saints; ſurely the Angels humility is a Myſtery.</p>
            <p>Again, That a man ſhould uſe the World, as if he did not<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 29. 30, 31.</note> uſe it: <hi>weep,</hi> as if he did not <hi>weep [weep</hi> and <hi>not weep</hi>], <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, as though he rejoyced not [rejoyce,</hi> and <hi>not rejoyce]: And they that</hi> buy, as though they <hi>poſſeſſed not; [buy,</hi> and <hi>not buy</hi>] that they that have <hi>Wives,</hi> he as though they had <hi>none, [mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,</hi> and yet <hi>unmarried</hi>], it is a Myſtery.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Self-denial</hi> is a Myſtery: For take a Saint, there's no man <hi>denieth</hi> himſelf ſo much as <hi>he;</hi> and yet there's no man<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 27.</note> 
               <hi>ſeeks</hi> himſelf ſo much as <hi>he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>Affliction</hi> is a Myſtery: That God ſhould <hi>kill his people,</hi> and yet <hi>love them,</hi> and put them in his boſom; it is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Perſecution</hi> for Jeſus Chriſt is a Myſtery: <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 16. 25</note> 
               <hi>will ſave his life, ſhould loſe it [ſave,</hi> and <hi>not ſave</hi>]: <hi>and whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhould find it; [loſe,</hi> and <hi>not loſe it</hi>], it is a Myſtery.</p>
            <p>That a man ſhould <hi>hate himſelf,</hi> and yet <hi>love himſelf;</hi> nay, <hi>love</hi> himſelf <hi>beſt,</hi> when he <hi>hates</hi> himſelf <hi>moſt</hi> for God, it is a Myſtery.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Patience in Affliction,</hi> is a ſtrange Myſtery; for a man to ſit down <hi>cheerfully,</hi> and be <hi>content</hi> with his <hi>Condition</hi> in all <hi>changes</hi> and <hi>varieties,</hi> is a Myſtery: That a man ſhould be <hi>toſſed, and moved up and down,</hi> and yet be <hi>unmoveable,</hi> it is a Myſtery: To be at <hi>home,</hi> and yet to be a <hi>Stranger,</hi> and a <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim</hi> in his own <hi>Houſe,</hi> and among his own <hi>Children,</hi> is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
            <p>And therefore, ſaith St. <hi>Paul, I know both how to be abaſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and I know how to abound; every where, and in all things I am inſtructed</hi> [The word is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            </p>
            <p>9. When God is <hi>deſtroying</hi> his Church, he is <hi>multiplying</hi> his Church; when he is <hi>pulling her down,</hi> he is <hi>ſetting her up:</hi> As when you ſee a man pulling down an <hi>old</hi> or <hi>deformed</hi> houſe; you ſay, ſurely he is building up a <hi>fairer:</hi> when a Taylor is ripping the Cloath, and cutting it into <hi>ſhreds</hi> and <hi>pieces,</hi> he is making a comely <hi>Garment.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:55699:11"/>
            <p>Again, Sometimes when a Sinner is galloping in the high way of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> he is in his way of <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>ſalvation:</hi> God meets him in the way, and makes his way <hi>from Heaven,</hi> his way <hi>to Heaven:</hi> As <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was going to <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> went (in <hi>his</hi> Intention) to undo the Saints, but went (in <hi>Gods</hi> Intention) to be made a Saint.</p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>It is a matchleſs and bleſſed priviledg to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my Diſcourſe upon this ſubject I ſhall (through Divine aſſiſtance) ſhew you,</p>
            <p>1. What are the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the Kingdom of Heaven?</p>
            <p>2. Why it is ſuch a Priviledg to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven?</p>
            <p>1. What are the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven?</p>
            <p>1. They are <hi>Latent</hi> and ſecret things; they are <hi>hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;</hi> and therefore are they called <hi>Mysteries:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, which is [<hi>Claudo</hi>] to ſhut up under ſecrecy.</p>
            <p>For ſecret things are not ſpoken, but lockt up in the heart. But I rather think, that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> comes from <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to hide, or keep cloſe: And from the ſame word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> came <hi>Saturnus,</hi> who hid himſelf in <hi>Italy</hi> (as the Poets Fable) which was therefore called <hi>Latium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this account are the matters of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven called <hi>Myſteries,</hi> becauſe they are unknown to Nature, they are hidden, till they are revealed: <hi>Man</hi> could never have <hi>known</hi> them, had <hi>God</hi> never <hi>revealed</hi> them: And though they are revealed, yet they are ſtill Myſteries to carnal men who hear the Goſpel, and yet do not underſtand it.</p>
            <p>2. They are excellent and ſtately things, becauſe they are the Myſteries of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> They are high My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, for they are Myſteries of a Kingdom, and of the higheſt Kingdom too, for they are the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven. Never were there any ſuch Myſteries of State as theſe: and truly, they that are acquainted with them, are of <hi>Gods Privy-Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee why they are called Myſteries:</p>
            <p>But what are they?</p>
            <p>They are the <hi>Plot</hi> or <hi>Deſign</hi> of Gods wiſdom which he hath contrived in order to Mans ſalvation, the <hi>ſacred Principles</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55699:11"/> and <hi>Doctrines of Christian Religion:</hi> the <hi>Plat-form</hi> and <hi>Draught</hi> of his Will, according to which he will ſave Man. For the Church is ſtiled a Kingdom, and Jeſus Chriſt is the King; and the <hi>Laws</hi> of this Kingdom are Myſteries, becauſe it is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom, the Kingdom of Heaven; they are Laws of an higher and more ſublime nature, than the Laws that any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom hath.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> be a Myſtery to ſilly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men; what are the <hi>Imperial Laws</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly,</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is called a Myſtery: <hi>Without controverſie great is the Mystery of godlineſs, God manifest in the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Myſtery, not only <hi>not known</hi> by Nature, to humane<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> Reaſon, but being known and revealed, <hi>far tranſcends</hi> the conception thereof. We do not ſo much believe it by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as underſtand it by our belief.</p>
            <p>This is the Myſtery of all the Myſteries; the <hi>Master-piece</hi> and <hi>flower</hi> of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and conjunction of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Church, Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>This is a great Myſtery, and I ſpeak</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>concerning Chriſt and the Church;</hi> that Chriſt and his Church ſhould be Man and Wife! that there ſhould be a conjugal one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between them! that a perſon of ſuch <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Distance</hi> ſhould marry ſo poor a Bride, and make her his Queen!</p>
            <p>2. Why is it ſuch a Priviledg to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe Knowledg is wondrous deſirable, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to the Nature of man: for man is a rational creature, and therefore deſires to know all things that are knowable: There's a rational deſire in man breathing after Knowledg: Knowledg is (as it were) mans <hi>Element,</hi> wherein he <hi>breathes</hi> and <hi>lives:</hi> as <hi>ſenſe</hi> is the <hi>Element</hi> of bruits and beaſts, they wallow in <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and walk within the circumference of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> higher they cannot go: ſo <hi>Knowledg</hi> is the Element of man, his <hi>native air</hi> (as it were) wherein he is born and bred, and which he ſucks in delightfully: The air of Knowledg is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous pleaſant to man; and therefore he loves to take the air, read Books, and ſearch after Knowledg.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The Knowledg of the Myſteries of Heaven, is a Knowledg that will <hi>ſave</hi> thee. It is [<hi>Scientia ſcientiarum</hi>]
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55699:12"/> the ſcience of ſciences, the Knowledg of all Knowledges: it is a Knowledg that will ſave thee, and do thee moſt good, and ſtand thee in the greateſt ſtead; it is a Knowledg that will do thy ſoul good, a Knowledg that will put thee into Heaven: It is the <hi>Object</hi> that makes the Knowledg: Knowledg derives its Excellency from its <hi>Object;</hi> Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, I count all things but loſs and dung for the excellency of the Knowledg of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, that I may be found in him.</hi> The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of natural things, leaves thee but a natural man, a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poliſhed<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8, 9.</note> natural man; but the Knowledg of Chriſt makes thee a Saint; the Knowledg of <hi>Jeſus ſaves thee from thy ſins;</hi> the moſt exquiſite Knowledg of all natural things leaves thee in thy ſins, but the Knowledg of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt ſaves thee from thy ſins:</hi> And therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified:</hi> Becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> knew, that no Knowledg would ſave himſelf, and no Knowledg<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2.</note> he made others know, would ſave them, but the Knowledg of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If all the men in the World were wounded, and lay at the point of Death, and there were but <hi>one herb</hi> in all the World that would heal them; How would they all ſend abroad to know that one Herb, and to know the virtue of it, and how to uſe it, and apply it? How happy would they count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Knowledg of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Beloved,</hi> All the Men and Women in the World are wounded, they are wounded to death, and lye gaſping for life; and there is but one Herb in all the World that can heal and ſave them, and that is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>Divine nature</hi> did grow out of the boſom of <hi>God the Father</hi> from all Eternity, and whoſe <hi>humane Nature</hi> did grow out of the ſanctified Womb of the <hi>Virgin;</hi> Oh! how precious ſhould be the Knowledg of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> then unto you? Surely it is the greateſt priviledg to know <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Grace begins</hi> in <hi>Knowledg,</hi> in the Knowledg of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, as the ſtream begins in the ſpring: for <hi>Knowledg</hi> is the ſpring of <hi>Grace:</hi> the Knowledg of God is the ſpring of our <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God:</hi> the Knowledg of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of God, is the ſpring of our <hi>Truſt</hi> in God. <hi>They that know thy name, will truſt in thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 9. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Knowledg that <hi>ſaves</hi> us, is not a bare notion of God, it knows

            <p>Again, ſaith he, <hi>That the chiefeſt Power, whatſoever it is,</hi> (meaning God) <hi>hath care of mankind, or of mens affairs, is a thing to be derided or ſcorn'd at.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Whether he ſpeaks this, being forced by Conviction, or out of Pollicy (to keep men within Bounds) rather than of Faith, I know not, though I conceive the latter by his following words: <hi>To believe that the Gods have care of mens Eſtates, is uſeful for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55699:13"/> this life; As alſo that the puniſhment of Malefactors is ſometimes late (becauſe God is buſily employed otherwiſe in ſo vaſt a frame as this World is) but never miſſeth in the end.</hi>

And ye Saints of God, if this were truth, then <hi>ye</hi> alſo <hi>of all men are the moſt miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he doth inſtance alſo in other things which God <hi>cannot</hi> do, and which we grant.

            <p>1. It lays open the Myſteries of Heaven to you: there may be a great deal of Riches wrapped up in a Treaſury, but this opens and unlocks the Treaſury: The Miniſtry of the Word is ordained to lay open the Treaſure to Gods People, that they may know what Riches they have by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be rich Mines in the Scripture, but they muſt be digged up: The Miniſtry ſerves to dig up thoſe Mines, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55699:15"/> lay them open above-ground, that the Saints may ſee them, and be in love with them.</p>
            <p>2. The Preaching of the Goſpel caſts the <hi>ſweet ſavour</hi> of the Myſteries of Heaven abroad the World, and renders them lovely.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Woman</hi> that brought her Box of Oyntment to anoint the Lord Jeſus with it, when ſhe opened the Box, the room was filled with the Odour of the Oyntment: were not the Box opened, the Oyntment would not ſmell: ſo the preaching of the Word, is the opening of the Box.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel (which is a rich <hi>compound</hi> made up of the <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſpices</hi> and <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Heaven) I ſay the Goſpel is a Box of ſweet Oyntment, and the Preaching of it is the opening of the Box; if it be not opened, it caſts not its ſweet ſavour abroad the World. The publiſhing of the Word, is the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Box, and the caſting of the perfume of it abroad the World: Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Now thanks be unto God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note>

            </p>
            <p>3. The preaching of the Goſpel applies the Myſteries of Heaven to mens Souls in particular: It diſtributes the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to every Child of God: The Miniſters of God are the <hi>Stewards</hi> of God to diſtribute the Myſtery of comfort, and the Myſtery of pardon, and peace, to whom they belong: Now where there is an equal and convenient diſtribution of the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to every one, this makes the Ordinance of God ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the Myſteries of Heaven ſo delicious; this makes the people taſte them, taſte the Myſtery of comfort, and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of peace and pardon; when the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the <hi>ſpring</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to every mans particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe, they taſte them, and reliſh them.</p>
            <p>And 'tis this that makes the Word in the Application of it ſo ſweet a thing: I ſay the Word in the Application of it is a ſweet thing; for <hi>good things,</hi> the nearer they are brought home, the more delightful they are; as a Roſe on the Tree is a ſweet thing; whether you ſmell it, or ſmell it not, 'tis ſweet; but if it be brought home to you, and put into your boſom, then you ſmell it ſweet: So the Myſtery of peace and pardon, as it grows upon the Tree of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> is a ſweet thing; but if the Hand of <hi>Application</hi> bring it home to you, and put
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55699:15"/> in thy boſom, there thou art ſweetned with it.</p>

            <p>And if any thing in the World make God to leave a Church, as he left the Jews, and as he may leave any particular Church, it is becauſe there is not a prizing of the Heavenly Myſteries we have.</p>
            <p>For however <hi>we</hi> eſteem theſe things, God ſets an high price upon them; and if we do not, God will deprive us of them, and of the Power and Beauty of them.</p>

            <p>To know any thing, the Knowledg of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would be of greateſt worth unto thee; and yet to know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> would not advantage thee, but as a <hi>means</hi> and <hi>door</hi> to let thee in to acquaintance with <hi>God</hi> himſelf: The Knowledg of <hi>Christ</hi> would not ſave thee, did not the Knowledg of him lead thee into the Knowledg of, and acquaintance with God himſelf.

            </p>
            <p>2. It is a wondrous priviledg that any man affords us, to let us know him, and to be intimate with him: What can he do more, than to unvail himſelf to us, and let us ſee his <hi>inſide,</hi> and let us peep into the <hi>Cabinet</hi> of his ſecrets, and make us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all his Excellencies? It is the greateſt love that can be: A man may invite us often to his Table, and make us ſit down with him, and yet not let us know himſelf; nay you may live with him all your days, and converſe with him, and yet he not let you know his <hi>inward ſelf,</hi> nor what is in himſelf: Hee'l make himſelf known to none, but whom he makes his <hi>ſecond ſelf!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah then! how are we engaged to God? That thou wilt let us know thy face, and know thy mind, and know thy heart; What is this, but to make us thy <hi>ſecond ſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. God doth not only let us know <hi>him,</hi> but he knows <hi>us:</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Galatians, But now, after that ye</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 9.</note> 
               <hi>have known God, or rather are known of God: We</hi> know not God ſo much as <hi>He</hi> knows us. We are rather known of him, than know him: 'tis more that <hi>he</hi> knows us, than that <hi>we</hi> know him: As when a poor man lives by a great man,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55699:16"/> and knows him, it doth not do him ſo much good that <hi>he</hi> knows the <hi>great man,</hi> as that the <hi>great man</hi> knows him, and communicates ſome of his greatneſs to him; The great mans Knowledg of him makes him a great man: though he knows the <hi>great man,</hi> yet if the <hi>great man</hi> know not him, and take not notice of him, he's never the better: So we may by <hi>nature</hi> know God, and by the <hi>Scripture</hi> know the Attributes of God, yet this doth us no good, unleſs the Lord know us, and communicate his riches and greatneſs to us. It is the happineſs of the Subject, that his Prince will know him: All the Honour of one that is in low degree, ſprings from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg his Superior takes of him. <hi>Zacheus</hi> ran and went up in<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 3.</note> to the <hi>Sycamore-tree,</hi> that he might ſee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and know him; but it was <hi>Zacheus</hi> happineſs (and the riſe of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would know him, and caſt an eye upon him.</p>

            <p>There are three ways to know God:</p>
            <p>1. By the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the Creatures, which is proper to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> I ſay, proper to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in this <hi>ſenſe,</hi> That they had no other glaſs to ſee God in, no other book in which they could read the Divine Excellencies: The book of the Creature was the only <hi>Scripture</hi> they had, wherein God was diſcovered to them, and in it they might have ſeen and read much of God, as the Apoſtle argueth: <hi>For the inviſible</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> 
               <hi>things of him from the creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God-head, ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By the <hi>report</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the reading of Scripture: and this was proper to the <hi>Jews:</hi> This was their priviledg or advantage (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>For unto them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:55699:17"/> 
               <hi>the oracles of God;</hi> that is, <hi>they</hi> received all the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of his Will, the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> they were the only people with whom God thought fit to <hi>depoſite</hi> all theſe: they were the only Cabinet in which God laid up the Jewel of the <hi>Scripture: To</hi> them and for <hi>them</hi> he wrote his Law: <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his judgments</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 147. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>unto Iſrael; he hath not dealt ſo with any nation: and as for his judgments they have not known them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. By <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is proper to <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Knowledg of God, which they get, who know him by the <hi>Creatures,</hi> is like that Knowledge which we have of a man only by ſeeing ſome of his Workmanſhip which he hath wrought.</p>
            <p>The Knowledge of God, which they get who know him by the holy Scriptures (I mean a literal Knowledg) is like to that Knowledg which another gets of a Famous learned Man, by reading the things which he hath written.</p>
            <p>The Knowledg of God which they get who know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is like to that Knowledg which one hath of the King by having ſeen his Image, or rather his Son, who is the true and very Image of his Father: Hence ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Philip,</hi> When he ſaid, <hi>Shew us the Father, and it ſufficeth us:</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 14. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Have I been ſo long time with you, and yet haſt thou not known me, Philip? He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father, and how ſayeſt thou then, Shew us the Father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now through Gods infinite mercy <hi>we</hi> have the benefit of <hi>all theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have the book of the <hi>Creature,</hi> wherein we may read the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Subſiſtence</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>We have (beſides that) the book of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may read the <hi>Will</hi> of God; which is a ſtep or ſtair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the other: for in the book of the <hi>Creature</hi> we can read no more than the <hi>Being,</hi> and ſome attributes of God, that <hi>God is,</hi> and that he is <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>powerful,</hi> &amp;c. but not <hi>one tittle</hi> of his <hi>Will</hi> there: only the book of Scripture ſhews us the VVill of God, the VVill of his <hi>Commands,</hi> what our duty is, and what we muſt do that we may be ſaved:</p>
            <p>And the VVill of his <hi>Decrees</hi> diſpoſing of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> to their laſt end or eternal ſtate.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe, we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have another book, written
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55699:17"/> as it were) with the Rays of the Sun, who is ſtiled <hi>the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fathers glory,</hi> even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I call him a <hi>Book,</hi> for he is ſtiled [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>the Word of God.</hi> But he is a book not made of <hi>Ink</hi> and <hi>Paper,</hi> but [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] a <hi>living Book,</hi> in whom we read the Treaſures of his Fathers Glory, Wiſdom, Love and Mercy to us in our Redemption: <hi>Of</hi> him the firſt Teſtament propheſied; <hi>Him</hi> the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declared.</p>
            <p>He was from everlaſting, yet may be ſaid to be <hi>printed</hi> and <hi>ſet forth</hi> when he was born of the Virgin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Book, and God was never known viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly till Chriſt came, for he is <hi>God manifeſt in the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, 'tis the property of the Chriſtian to take up the Knowledg of God in Chriſt, and to believe in God through Chriſt, and to converſe with God in Chriſt: He is the <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> of all the Myſteries of Heaven: the <hi>ſap</hi> and <hi>quinteſſence</hi> of Religion.</p>
            <p>Theſe being premiſed, we will now give you ſome Tryals of a ſaving Knowledg of the Myſteries of Heaven:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They that know the Myſteries of Heaven ſavingly, know them clearly. For this is a ſpiritual Knowledg, not only in reſpect of the <hi>Object,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though it be not <hi>without</hi> the Scripture, yet it ſprings not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone <hi>from</hi> the Scripture, but from the effectual Irradiations of the ſpirit of Wiſdom and Revelation.</p>
            <p>That, look as the <hi>literal</hi> Knowledg makes an Addition of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcoveries to the natural; ſo this ſpiritual Knowledg ſuperadds even to the literal, namely <hi>clearneſs</hi> of light. <hi>My Beloved,</hi> you muſt underſtand it thus: The things which the Holy Ghoſt diſcovers, are no other for ſubſtance, but thoſe very things which are in Scripture, only he gives a <hi>clearer light</hi> to diſcern them by.</p>
            <p>To Inſtance,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God is:</hi> Every man ſaith he knows this, and believes it, as well as the godly doth. But I muſt tell him, That the <hi>godly</hi> man ſeeth a great deal <hi>further</hi> into it: he ſeeth that <hi>God is,</hi> as truly as he ſeeth that the Sun is, when it ſhines upon him: And therefore <hi>God is in all his thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wicked man will tell you, he knows that God is <hi>preſent</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55699:18"/> in all places, and yet he will be drunk in God Preſence, ſwear and lye in Gods Preſence, cheat, and deal unjuſtly in Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: How can this man ſay, he believes that God is preſent where he is? But now the godly Man ſeeth that God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in all places, as clearly as if God appeared viſibly to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They know <hi>feelingly:</hi> they feel what they know: what they know in the head, they feel in the heart.</p>
            <p>And they count themſelves to know no more than they feel: as <hi>Melancthon</hi> makes mention of a godly Woman, who having ſtrong conflicts upon her <hi>Death-bed,</hi> and was afterwards much comforted, brake out into theſe words, <hi>Now, and not till now, I underſtand the meaning of thoſe words [Thy ſins are forgiven thee</hi>].</p>
            <p>The Knowledg of Divine Myſteries is rather a <hi>ſpiritual ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> than <hi>ſpeculation:</hi> It lyeth more in ſenſe and feeling, than in underſtanding of them: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the ſoul it ſelf hath its <hi>ſenſe,</hi> as well as the body; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>David</hi> would teach us how to know what the <hi>Divine goodneſs</hi> is, he calls not for <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> but <hi>ſenſation, Taſte and ſee how good the Lord is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Know <hi>God,</hi> as thou wouldeſt have God know thee; know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as thou wouldeſt have Chriſt know thee.</p>
            <p>Thou wouldeſt have God know thee, and take care of thee; ſo muſt thou know him, and take care of his Glory: Thou wouldeſt have God know thee, and ſuccour thee in dangers, as the Diſciples (when the Waves covered the ſhip) ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Maſter, careſt thou not that we periſh?</hi> So muſt thou<note place="margin">Mark 4. 38.</note> know God and his Cauſe, ſo as to prop it up in difficult times, leſt it periſh.</p>
            <p>Thou wouldeſt have Chriſt know thee, ſo as to dye for thee; Lord if thou dye not for me, I muſt be damned; ſo muſt thou know Chriſt, ſo as to dye for him and his Truth; <hi>I am ready,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 21. 13.</note> 
               <hi>not only to be bound, but to dye at Jeruſalem for the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou wouldeſt have Chriſt know thee, ſo as to love thee, and put thee in his boſom [<hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me</hi>]<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> So muſt thou know Chriſt, ſo as to love him, and put him into thy boſom, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 21. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity,</hi> or love, is the moſt eminent of all the <hi>Graces,</hi> inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55699:18"/> as <hi>Faith</hi> ſhall fail, when there ſhall be nothing to believe, nor to have confidence in; and <hi>Hope</hi> ſhall fail, when Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, and the reſurrection of the juſt being made, there ſhall be nothing more to hope for.</p>
            <p>Only <hi>Love</hi> ſhall never fail: for there ſhall be always <hi>what</hi> to love, and what to taſte: For in eternal life we ſhall love God and Chriſt, and we ſhall find a perpetual reliſh and ſavour in the contemplation of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Know the things that are prepared and given thee of God: Therefore is the ſpirit given us, that <hi>me may know the things</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>that God hath given us:</hi> What is it to know Heaven, unleſs thou knoweſt that Heaven is given thee of God?

            <p>As there be Thundrings without, ſo there be Thundrings within: In great Majeſty doth Chriſt ſpeak to the ſoul ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; Ask your <hi>Conſciences</hi> elſe; ask <hi>Faelix,</hi> the <hi>Jaylour,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> elſe; yea, ask your Father <hi>Adam</hi> elſe; what a caſe were all theſe in, when Chriſt did but <hi>reaſon</hi> with them!
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55699:19"/> Yea, I ask you <hi>Hypocrites</hi> (if any here) is not the way of Chriſt full of Majeſty? What means thoſe <hi>loads</hi> that gather about your hearts, and that <hi>fearfulneſs</hi> which ſurpriſeth you? <hi>Thou dost but touch the mountains, and they ſmoke</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmist</hi>), ſo God doth but touch your Conſciences, and they ſmoke: he doth but whiſper within, and your ſpirits fly about every where, into the fingers, into the face, and up into the head, and the heart within beats for want of them, ready to ſwoon away.</p>
            <p>Ask <hi>wounded ſpirits</hi> whether Gods Word be not full of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: Twenty years time not enough to heal the wound of a word of Gods mouth: Oh the Majeſty of that word!</p>
            <p>Look upon the whole Creation, upon the Earth, upon the Sea, upon the Heavens, do they not all-ſpeak the Majeſty of Chriſt? God is <hi>mightier than the noiſe of many waters,</hi> yea, than the Mighty waves of the Sea. The toſſings, rollings, and roarings of the Sea, Do they not ſpeak loudly the Majeſty of Chriſt? But, ah ſinner! The toſſings, rollings, and roarings of a <hi>troubled ſoul,</hi> ſpeak the Majeſty of Chriſts word much more: <hi>Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord, we perſwade men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Kingdoms</hi> have <hi>Supremacy:</hi> This is <hi>Baſis Majeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Christ</hi> is a <hi>great</hi> King over all, as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> titles him.<note place="margin">Pſal. 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>God hath ſet Chriſt over all, ſo ſhould we; as God hath ſet him, ſo do you, over all, in all things.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>ſelf-denyal</hi> is an excellent means that Chriſt may Reign: Thou muſt deny <hi>thy</hi> Kingdom, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may have <hi>his;</hi> you muſt lay down your Crowns at his feet, that he may wear his Crown upon his Head.</p>
            <p>And this is a ſweet Teſtimony of Grace in the heart, if the heart can endure Tribulation, that Chriſt may Reign; If it can ſuffer all things, that Chriſt may do all things; if it can lye low, that Chriſt may be exalted; when we are moſt <hi>annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> our Lord and his Myſteries are moſt <hi>admired.</hi>

            <p>They adore God, that they ſhould <hi>know</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> thoſe <hi>ſaving ſecrets</hi> which are hid from the eyes of ſo many round about them.</p>

               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The true Knowledg of ſpiritual things doth <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualize.</hi> True Knowledg of Religion makes a man <hi>Religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religion in Scripture is called <hi>Godlineſs: Without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie great is the Myſtcry of godlineſs;</hi> that is, The principles of<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Godlineſs is great gain, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſtianity. The Chriſtian Religion is great gain: Thus the Truths them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are called <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of them begets an inward godlineſs.</p>
            <p>As Religion it ſelf is called <hi>Faith,</hi> and the grace in the ſoul is alſo called <hi>Faith:</hi> Why ſo? To ſhew that Faith begets Faith; that is, the Truth revealed begets Faith, and muſt be received by Faith.</p>
            <p>Therefore one word includes both the <hi>Object,</hi> the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and likewiſe the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of the ſoul to that Object. So Religion is called <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> becauſe the true Knowledg of it begets <hi>Godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh!</hi> See then what makes a true Chriſtian: What, when a man nakedly believes Divine Truths? When he knows the <hi>Principles</hi> of Faith, doth that make him a <hi>true Chriſtian?</hi> No: But when Religion makes him Religious, when theſe<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 1.</note> Truths work <hi>Godlineſs:</hi> for Religion is a <hi>truth according to godlineſs.</hi> Where the Truths of Religion are embraced, there is <hi>Godlineſs</hi> with them: A man cannot embrace Religion in Truth, but he muſt be godly; becauſe <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> ſo it is called, for that it tends to beget all Piety, and Virtue, and Godlineſs in the heart.</p>
            <p>And therefore if the Myſteries of Heaven work not God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, a man hath but an <hi>Humane</hi> Knowledg of <hi>Divine</hi> things.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Lucius</hi> a bloody Perſecutor offered to confeſs his <hi>Faith,</hi> hoping thereby to gain an opinion that he was <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi>

            <p>We know the Holineſs of God by the Beam of Holineſs which he hath irradicated into our hearts: We know the love of God by the working of love in us towards him, and towards his Saints: We know hatred of ſin in God, by knowing in our ſelves an hatred of ſin; we know the Mercy of God, by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our ſelves an Image of his Mercy towards our Enemies; As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Be ye merciful, as your heavenly Fathers is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful.</hi>

            <p>The ſpirit makes me to know <hi>Omnipotency</hi> in God, through the great Power which he ſhews in me, mortifying me, and making me alive: The ſpirit makes me know Wiſdom in God, by the Wiſdom which I get through his Holy Spirit; he makes me know Juſtice in God, becauſe he juſtifieth me in Chriſt; he makes me know Truth in God, becauſe he keeps promiſe with me: he makes me know goodneſs and mercy in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he bears with my ſlothfulneſs and ſins.</p>
            <p>

            <p>A man never ſtands firm, and ſolid, and conſtant in the Faith, till he hath in himſelf ſome experience of that which he knows and believes.</p>

            <p>It befalls us in believing and knowing the Goſpel, as it doth in knowing at firſt ſome wiſe and godly Man.</p>
            <p>As long as we know the Wiſdom and Godlineſs of ſuch a man, only by the relation of other men, we are ſo diſpoſed, that other men coming, and making a contrary relation, we change our opinion we had of him, at leaſt doubt of it, till at laſt having ſtrict familiarity with him our ſelves, we know by experience that the relation of him is true, which was made to us, and then no man is able to perſwade us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>So long as we believe the Goſpel, and the Myſteries of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only by the relation of Preachers, we believe it, till other Preachers come and tell us the contrary, and then we believe the other way, or at leaſt doubt of the Truth we had from the firſt Preacher, till by having experience of that which is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel, we ſtand firm and conſtant in that which we know and believe; and then all the men in the World are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>unſettle</hi> or <hi>change</hi> our Faith and Knowledg, after 'tis <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> by our own <hi>experience.</hi>

            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55699:23"/>
            <p>And let me tell you, One great means to <hi>irradiate</hi> your Knowledg of the Myſteries of Heaven, is to know that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> that <hi>is</hi> in you, and that Myſtery of <hi>miſery</hi> that <hi>lieth</hi> upon you: It is not to be conceived (as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith), <hi>How deceitful the heart is, and how deſperately wickea, what a depth of corruption lyeth there?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>curſed</hi> and woful ſtate we are in by nature, is not to be conceived: Man's apprehenſion is <hi>too little</hi> to take in all the Dimenſions of it: to lye under the <hi>eternal wrath of God,</hi> what head can comprehend it? VVhat <hi>created ſoul</hi> can fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom in her wideſt thoughts the <hi>wrath of an infinite God?</hi> Who can tell what <hi>Hell is?</hi> And how hot the fire is which Gods <hi>Almighty wrath</hi> hath kindled to <hi>all eternity? As eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him: ſo neither hath eye ſeen, nor ear heard, nor can the heart of man conceive</hi> thoſe depths and treaſures of <hi>miſery</hi> that men are in by nature: Here we may cry out, <hi>Oh the depths!</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more tranſparent Knowledg we have of the <hi>Myſtery of Corruption,</hi> and of the <hi>dreadful miſery</hi> we are in by ſin, the more we ſhall wonder at the unparalell'd goodneſs of God in the <hi>Myſtery of our ſalvation;</hi> the one will ſharpen the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of the other.</p>
            <p>Truly Sirs, if you are yet in the ſtate of ſin, conſider how little there is between you and eternal Death; you are ready to drop into Hell immediately and irrecoverably: Did theſe things ſit ſadly and ſeriouſly upon your ſpirits, how would it advance the Knowledg of the Myſteries of Heaven?</p>
            <p>2. That you may know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, bring Humility, and ſelf-denial.</p>
            <p>Humble <hi>reaſon,</hi> and make her give place to <hi>Faith:</hi> for the humility (we here ſpeak of) is a Denial of our own <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Wits,</hi> though they be never ſo <hi>capacious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this caſe the <hi>Intellectus</hi> muſt be <hi>raſa tabula:</hi> I ſay, the underſtanding muſt be as a Table ſcraped, all the Writings and Notions of humane Wit and Reaſon muſt be ſcraped out: It muſt be like the Wax that hath no Character, that it may receive the Impreſſion of the Seal.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>reaſon</hi> ſhould do in <hi>ſupernatural things,</hi> is to ſtoop to <hi>Faith,</hi> to believe the things of God upon the ſole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55699:23"/> of God: Here it is the <hi>greateſt reaſon</hi> to yield to <hi>Faith;</hi> In Divine Myſteries Faith is the reaſon of reaſon; and the higheſt reaſon is to yield to God that hath revealed them: And therefore Faith ſtands with the greateſt reaſon that can be; for is it not the greateſt reaſon in the world to believe <hi>him,</hi> that is <hi>Truth it ſelf?</hi> Reaſon it ſelf ſaith, It is the greateſt reaſon to believe <hi>God</hi> who is the <hi>firſt Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Wait upon the ſpirit. Give the ſpirit that Honour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal theſe Myſteries to you.</p>
            <p>For your eyes are blind: you have an inward darkneſs upon you: the <hi>Goſpel</hi> takes away the Vail from the <hi>things,</hi> but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> takes away the Vail from our <hi>ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> had a Vail of <hi>types</hi> and <hi>ſhadows</hi> thrown over the things themſelves; now I ſay, <hi>Our Goſpel</hi> takes away the Vail from the things, but the ſpirit muſt take away the Vail from our hearts.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Nature</hi> there is need of a double light, that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Objects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>A light ſomeneſs</hi> upon the <hi>Object</hi> it ſelf through the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium;</hi> and therefore men cannot ſee in the <hi>night,</hi> becauſe the <hi>air,</hi> which is the <hi>Medium,</hi> is dark.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>light</hi> beſides in the <hi>Organ,</hi> that is the eye; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blind men cannot ſee in the <hi>day;</hi> becauſe though the Sun ſhines, and things may be ſeen in themſelves, yet they want a light in the eye.</p>
            <p>So, though the former darkneſs which lay upon the Myſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Heaven be taken away, thoſe <hi>legal ſhadows</hi> and curtains are removed, and the Sun of the Goſpel ſhines full upon our faces, yet we are blind within, there lyeth an inward darkneſs upon our <hi>faculty:</hi> and the ſpirit muſt open our eyes, and give us a <hi>vital</hi> light to joyn with the outward light.</p>
            <p>4. Send up your prayers to Heaven: The <hi>holy Vapours</hi> of Prayer aſcending, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> comes down in ſhowres upon the ſoul: The earth muſt ſend up Vapours, before the Clouds can give down rain: And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> prays for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> That God would give them <hi>the ſpirit of Wiſdom and Revelation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>that the eyes of their underſtanding being enlightned, they might know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the ſaints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. He that would find the knowledg of Divine Myſteries,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55699:24"/> muſt ſeek it with a ſanctified mind.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>enables</hi> us to know, and underſtand aright the things of God, muſt be a <hi>living principle</hi> of Holineſs in us.</p>

            <p>There is an <hi>inward</hi> ſweetneſs and deliciouſneſs in Divine Truth, which no <hi>ſenſual mind</hi> can taſte or reliſh.</p>

            <p>The more our ſouls <hi>dive</hi> into our bodies, the more will <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>ſenſuality</hi> run into one another, and make up a moſt <hi>unſavoury</hi> and <hi>muddy</hi> kind of Knowledg.</p>
            <p>And therefore wicked men, (let them imagine what they pleaſe) have no <hi>true</hi> Knowledg of God: <hi>Such as men themſelves are, ſuch will God himſelf ſeem to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the <hi>Maxim</hi> of moſt wicked men, that the <hi>Deity</hi> is ſome

            </p>
            <p>6. Know things as <hi>God</hi> doth know them: God, to <hi>exerciſe</hi> the wiſdom that he hath given to man, hath planted a <hi>difference</hi> in the Creatures, and hath given a <hi>faculty</hi> to man to know, and make a right choice in thoſe differences; and then man doth know things aright, when he knows them as God knows them; and then man makes a right choice, when he chuſeth as God chuſeth.</p>
            <p>Now God knows that <hi>riches</hi> are but little things; and that <hi>credit</hi> in the world is but a ſhadow, and that <hi>honours</hi> in <hi>high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> are but like <hi>leaves</hi> on the top of a tree; And who would climb a tree to fetch a leaf?</p>
            <p>But God knows that pardon of ſin is a choice rarity.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Obſerve here two things:</p>
            <p>1. It is a gift: To know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven (ſaith Chriſt) it is given to you: Dear ſouls! <hi>Fleſh and</hi>

            <p>I ſay, we take <hi>ſmall</hi> gifts thankfully, how much more <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> gifts? Such gifts as have <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> wrapt up in them? <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thy Being is a <hi>gift,</hi> but grace added to it is a <hi>bleſſing:</hi> to be born is a <hi>gift,</hi> but the new birth put to it is a <hi>bleſſing;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>It had been good for that man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>if he had never been born:</hi> To have Underſtanding and Knowledg is a <hi>great gift,</hi> but to <hi>know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven is a great bleſſing; Bleſſed are the eyes which ſee the things that</hi>

               <hi>ye ſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They are <hi>Myſteries:</hi> and will ye not bleſs God, that he ſhould make Myſteries known to you? They are Myſteries of his boſom; and is it nothing to be Gods <hi>boſom-friends?</hi> They are the Myſteries of his ſecret, wiſe, and eternal Counſels; And is it nothing to be Gods <hi>Privy-Counſellors?</hi> They are the Myſteries of <hi>eternal life;</hi> And is it nothing to know the <hi>Rolls</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> of eternity? (Saints, God hath made ye his <hi>Cutodes Rotulorum</hi>) is not eternal life a <hi>delicate</hi> flower to ſmell at? Is it nothing to ſee <hi>within the vail?</hi> Surely it is a great priviledg; therefore you may <hi>rejoyce</hi> in it, and <hi>bleſs</hi> God for it.</p>
            <p>And this leads us to the third Doctrine, which is this:</p>
            <p>Doct. 3. <hi>The Divine Knowledg of the Myſteries of Heaven is given to ſome, not to others.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:55699:25"/>
            <p>In this <hi>Doctrine</hi> there are <hi>three</hi> things clear and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>1. The Knowledg of Divine Myſteries is a <hi>gift. [To you it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>].</p>
            <p>What is given, is a <hi>gift:</hi> Divine Knowledg is a Divine gift: The Knowledg of the Myſteries of Heaven is a gift <hi>from</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: To know God, it is from God: <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the gift of God; and to know Chriſt is another gift: And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That faith is the gift of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 8. Pſal. 119. 125.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore ſaith <hi>David, Give me underſtanding, that I may know thy teſtimonies:</hi> To underſtand the Divine Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is a gift: God muſt not only give us the <hi>Objects</hi> of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but alſo the Knowledg of thoſe Objects.</p>
            <p>Man <hi>loſt</hi> his Knowledg; and therefore muſt be created again, and <hi>renewed in Knowledg after the image of him that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>created him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God muſt ſet him up again with a <hi>new ſtock</hi> of Knowledg, elſe Man can know nothing.</p>
            <p>The Myſteries of Heaven in themſelves are intelligible; they are glorious and radiant Objects, they ſparkle with ſplendour in our eyes; but blind men cannot ſee <hi>light</hi> without a <hi>light:</hi> we are dark within, while the Myſteries of Heaven ſhine (like the light) round about us: And therefore God muſt give the opening of the eye to ſee the out-breaking of the light upon us.</p>
            <p>2. The Knowledg of the Myſteries of Heaven is given to <hi>ſome: [To you it is given to know the Myſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven]. I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) that my Redeemer liveth,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> knew the Myſtery of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and in that glaſs he ſaw the Myſtery of the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> He knew one Myſtery in another: In that he knew he was <hi>redeemed,</hi> he knew he ſhould <hi>riſe again:</hi> Our <hi>redemption</hi> implieth our <hi>reſurrection: Job,</hi> though he lived in dark times, yet he knew theſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteires; becauſe to him it was given to know them: <hi>I know,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And he knew that thoſe <hi>Judgments</hi> were <hi>right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And he knew the <hi>myſtery</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of them, <hi>That God in faithfulneſs had afflicted him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, That <hi>his ſheep know his voice: I am the good</hi>

            </p>
            <p>They are gifted with diſcerning, that they know the <hi>voice</hi> or <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſt: they are ſo well acquainted with the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Heaven, that they know what is the Doctrine, and what is not the Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 15, 16.</note> There was a time when the Myſteries of Heaven were <hi>vailed</hi> from <hi>Paul,</hi> and afterward were <hi>revealed to Paul;</hi> God in his time gave him to know, what he did not know before.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the <hi>ſecond</hi> point, That the Knowledg of the Myſteries of Heaven is given to ſome.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In this diſpenſation of God (wherein to <hi>ſome</hi> he gives the

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In that he gives not to ſome the Knowledg of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Heaven, there appears <hi>Soveraignty:</hi> For in another Text the Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Father, thou hast hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes</hi>—<note place="margin">Mat. 11, 25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>Even ſo; Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> gives no other reaſon why the Myſteries of Heaven were <hi>hid</hi> from the <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>revealed</hi> to <hi>babes,</hi> but only his Fathers <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In this diſpenſation of God, wherein the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Divine Myſteries is not given to ſome, the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God appears: Which, that you may underſtand, I lay down theſe two Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>1. God hath inſtituted <hi>means</hi> for the obtaining of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural grace.</p>
            <p>2. Where God <hi>gives</hi> grace (in the uſe of means) he gives it <hi>freely;</hi> to whom God gives not grace, he denies it juſtly.</p>
            <p>1. God hath inſtituted <hi>means</hi> for the obtaining of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grace: <hi>For faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God:</hi> The Lord hath ſet the ſtamp of Inſtitution upon means wherein he will be found, as hearing the word, <hi>And when they heard this, they were pricked at the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reading the Word, Prayer, and Meditation.</p>
            <p>2. Where God gives grace in the uſe of means, he doth it <hi>freely;</hi> and to whom God gives not grace, he denieth it juſtly.</p>
            <p>1. Where God <hi>gives</hi> grace in the uſe of means, he gives it <hi>freely.</hi> Whether it be in the outward means, or the inward preparatory work: for he is not tyed by the means to us.</p>
            <p>Some ſay [<hi>Facienti quod in ſe eſt, Deus dabit Gratiam ulteriorem</hi>], To him that doth what he can do, more ſhall be given him; but though God ſhould ſometimes (or always) anſwer man in this kind, where do we find that he hath bound himſelf by Promiſe to do ſo?</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:55699:27"/>
            <p>Now I muſt ſhew you, That where God <hi>gives not</hi> grace, he doth it <hi>justly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the Goſpel, where God denieth grace, he never doth it but <hi>juſtly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God obſerves a <hi>distributive Juſtice</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>For the Saints (through grace) uſe the means to gain more grace; and Sinners, they refuſe all grace: For</p>
            <p>1. In the Church, ſalvation according to Gods Promiſe is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In the Church, the adminiſtration of grace is ſo high, as that it is ſufficient to convince all.</p>
            <p>3. Sinners periſh, and go without grace through their own fault. For,</p>
            <p>1. They neglect <hi>the means</hi> of the Knowledg of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Heaven.</p>
            <p>2. They deſpiſe the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven: And this reaſon Chriſt renders of it at the <hi>13th verſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpake I to them in parables, becauſe they ſeeing, ſee not: and hearing, they hear not, neither do they underſtand:</hi> As if he had ſaid, ſuch Minds as they bring to hear, ſuch Sermons do I bring to them, cloath'd with parables and obſcurities: They that <hi>will not</hi> underſtand things that are manifeſt, to them I wrap up my Sermons in clouds and darkneſs: <hi>They have eyes to ſee my manifeſt ſigns and miracles,</hi> yet being blinded with <hi>envy,</hi> they will not ſee what they ſee; <hi>They have ears,</hi> and hear the truth that is irreſutable, and yet in <hi>hearing they will not hear,</hi> i. e. <hi>they will not receive it, neither do they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,</hi> that is, it is ſo <hi>clear,</hi> that they <hi>may,</hi> but they <hi>will</hi> not underſtand.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak more particularly,</p>
            <p>1. Some will hear the Word, but not mind, it ſo as to underſtand it: their puniſhment is, That as <hi>they</hi> will go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with God, ſo God will go no further with <hi>them,</hi> but <hi>denieth</hi> unto them the ſpirit of Illumination, <hi>leaves</hi> them <hi>blind</hi> as he found<note place="margin">Math 13. 19.</note> them, and ſuffers <hi>Satan</hi> to take the word from them.</p>
            <p>2. Some receive the word ſo far, as to <hi>underſtand</hi> it, but are not willing to <hi>do</hi> it, they cannot digeſt the <hi>holineſs</hi> of it; their <hi>luſts,</hi> and its <hi>purity</hi> cannot ſtand together; their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, That God will not make it <hi>further effectual</hi> to <hi>promote</hi> their ſpiritual happineſs; though they may receive the <hi>ſpirit</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55699:28"/> of <hi>Illumination,</hi> yet not of <hi>Converſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Some receive the word ſo far into their hearts, as to <hi>delight</hi> in it, and to <hi>do</hi> ſomething commanded, and <hi>obey</hi> it in ſome degree; They proceed to <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and ſeveral mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof, but advance not to ſincerity and perfection; their puniſhment is, That the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is denied unto them, and for fear of Adverſity, or love of the World, they deny the truth in a day of tryal.</p>
            <p>Thus when we ſay, The Knowledg of the Myſteries of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is given to ſome, and not given to others; to thoſe to whom it is given, it is given freely; to thoſe to whom it is not given, it is denied juſtly: For this denial is a puniſhment, and therefore juſt: ſinners deſerve it, that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>The elect can ſpeak of <hi>underſerved-grace,</hi> and the reprobate of <hi>deſerved puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is ſo <hi>juſt,</hi> that he doth not condemn <hi>any</hi> but for ſin: ſo <hi>gracious,</hi> that he doth not condemn <hi>all</hi> that do ſin.</p>
            <p>Though God will ſave miſerable men <hi>without their merits,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>good;</hi> yet he will not damn any <hi>without their demerits,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to give you a clearer Proſpect of this Truth, that the Divine Knowledg of the Myſteries of Heaven is given to ſome, not to others; Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Sometimes God makes choice of an <hi>Alien,</hi> an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> before his own people in Covenant with him: As you may ſee in <hi>Jeremiah 38. 7, 8. verſes,</hi> He gives an <hi>Ethiopian</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jerem. 38. 7, 8.</note> grace, which he gave not to many a <hi>Jew: Ebedmelech</hi> was an <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> yet a Saint; a black <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> but a white Saint:<note place="margin">V</note> 
               <hi>None</hi> ſpeaks for the Prophet but <hi>he:</hi> an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> ſaves the <hi>Prophet,</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> did perſecute:</p>
            <p>Where obſerve</p>
            <p>1. How God picks <hi>one</hi> out of a whole Nation: God makes choice of <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> above all the Nation of the <hi>Ethiopians:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole Nation of his <hi>Countrey-men</hi> lay under the black Vail of darkneſs and ignorance, while <hi>he</hi> knew the Myſteries of Heaven.</p>
            <p>2. The wonder of Gods Providence, how it brings about the Salvation of a perſon, whom he means to ſave.</p>
            <p>God brings <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> out of his own Countrey, to make him a Saint: how he came thither, to live in the King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah's</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:55699:28"/> Court, there's no mention of it; but this we know, that he was brought thither upon the Wing of Providence, to know God, and to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>3. God gives grace to <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> and makes choice of <hi>him</hi> before many of his <hi>own people</hi> in Covenant with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He prefers the Servant before the Maſter: <hi>All the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 22.</note> 
               <hi>ſaints ſalute you, chiefly they that are of Caeſars houſhold:</hi> This <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> was <hi>Nero, in whoſe palace Saint Paul's bonds were made</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>manifeſt:</hi> So that ſome of his Servants were made <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who afterwards proved <hi>Martyrs,</hi> namely <hi>Evellius</hi> and <hi>Torpetes,</hi> if we may believe the <hi>Roman Martyrology;</hi> here the Vaſſal receives the Goſpel, which the <hi>Emperor</hi> doth not: The <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> are made <hi>lambs</hi> while their Lord and Maſter remains a <hi>Lyon;</hi> for ſo is he ſtiled in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God prefers the poor before the rich: a poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> before a rich <hi>Dives:</hi> he drops his golden ſhowres of grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a low ſhrub, and over-looks the tall Cedar: The truth of it is, <hi>Dives</hi> was poor, <hi>Lazarus</hi> was rich; <hi>Lazarus</hi> had more gold in his Soul, than <hi>Dives</hi> had in his Purſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hath not God choſen the poor in this world, rich in faith</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 5.</note> [i. e. to be rich in Faith] <hi>and heirs of the Kingdom?</hi> As we<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 5.</note> read it, <hi>Hath not God choſen the poor in this world, rich in faith:</hi> Some would argue, that they were <hi>choſen, becauſe rich in faith,</hi> as if their <hi>faith foreſeen</hi> were the <hi>cauſe</hi> of their choice: but the meaning is, <hi>Hath not God choſen the poor in this world</hi> [to be] <hi>rich in faith.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Chriſt Jeſus</hi> in the diſpenſations of grace, preferred <hi>ſtrangers</hi> above natural relations: He gives not grace accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to natural relation: he paſſed by many of his <hi>kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: For neither did his brethren believe in him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 7. 5. <hi>Trap. in Loc.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>And this the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day, read with ſuch wonderment, that they take occaſion from this Text to ſlander our Saviours miracles, ſith his own kindred believed not in him: but they are ignorant of the Myſtery of <hi>Free-grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, a man would have thought, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> would have given grace to his <hi>kindred</hi> before others; that he would have paſſed by none of his <hi>kindred;</hi> but though they were <hi>kin</hi> to him in the fleſh, yet he was <hi>God,</hi> and ſo above all Kindred and Relation to them: In reſpect of his <hi>Humane
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55699:29"/> Nature,</hi> he was of the ſame blood with them; but as God, he had no relation to them; <hi>Kindred</hi> and <hi>Conſanguinity</hi> is below the <hi>God-head: Conſanguinity</hi> runs in a line of blood, but God partakes not of fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But you will ſay, methinks the</hi> Humane Nature <hi>of Chriſt ſhould have deſired the converſion of his kindred more than others, and prevailed with the</hi> God-head <hi>for grace for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. The <hi>nearer</hi> one is united to <hi>God,</hi> the leſs he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of <hi>himſelf,</hi> and the more of God: Chriſts <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> united to the Deity, willed nothing with a private will, but all with an elevated will, moving according to the will of the God head.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>Saint,</hi> as far as he is ſanctified, wills nothing, but what God wills; but <hi>Chriſts</hi> Humane Nature was united <hi>perſonally</hi> to the <hi>God-head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Saints are <hi>myſtically</hi> united to God by Faith, <hi>morally</hi> united to God in love and affection; but Chriſts Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was <hi>perſonally</hi> united to the <hi>God-head,</hi> and therefore was more nearly united to God, than to all <hi>natural relation</hi> or <hi>kindred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Sometimes he paſſeth by the Children of Saints, and graffs in the Children of a prophane ſtock: he takes pearls out of <hi>Toads-heads,</hi> and digs <hi>golden mines</hi> out of a barren and dry earth; for ordinarily golden and ſilver Mines grow in the moſt barren Grounds and Mountains, not in your fruitful and rich ſoyls.</p>

               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Sometimes he prefers the younger before the elder; and ſo makes the <hi>firſt, laſt,</hi> and the <hi>laſt, firſt:</hi> and thus the Lord croſſeth man; for man writes <hi>Praerogaetive</hi> upon his firſt born, and makes him the firſt in his love; but God comes and writes quite contrary, and faith, I chuſe this for mine, and leave the elder.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Zachary,</hi> when all his friends would have his Son called<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 57. 63.</note>

               <hi>Cham,</hi> though the youngeſt, yet will be preferred above his Brethren, if we ſtand to the judgment of the <hi>Poets,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive <hi>Jove</hi> (or <hi>Jupiter</hi>) from <hi>Cham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, We ſhall give the firſt place to <hi>Japhet,</hi> who was the eldeſt Son, if we follow the order of Nature; but to <hi>Sem,</hi> if we follow the order of Grace, whom God prefer'd before his Brethren, not of <hi>merit,</hi> but out of free grace, and meer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Cham</hi> was the youngeſt of the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> you have an expreſs in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 24, and that <hi>Sem</hi> was not the firſt-born,<note place="margin">Gen. 9. 24.</note> it is manifeſt out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 10, Where 'tis ſaid, <hi>That Sem</hi>

               <hi>hundred and two;</hi> ſeeing he had begotten his firſt-born two years before, for he began to beget Children in his year <hi>five hundred,</hi> Gen. 5. 32. Therefore <hi>Sem</hi> was two years younger<note place="margin">Gen. 5. 32.</note>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:55699:30"/> than his brother that was firſt-born, that is <hi>Japhet,</hi> who is therefore called the elder, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 21.<note place="margin">Gen. 10. 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Japhet</hi> being the firſt-born of all the three, yet God prefer'd <hi>Sem before him;</hi> to ſhew that his Election was <hi>fire,</hi> and not tyed to the <hi>prerogative</hi> and worthineſs of Age; and to ſhew that there was not the ſame order of <hi>Grace,</hi> which is of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>nature</hi> gave many priviledges to the <hi>firſt-born;</hi> and preſently from the beginning of the World, God ſubjected <hi>Abel to Cain</hi> his elder brother; <hi>unto thee ſhall be his deſire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>and thou ſhalt rule over him;</hi> yet in <hi>grace</hi> he ſubjected <hi>Cain</hi> to <hi>Abel: The Lord had reſpect to Abel, and to his offering:</hi>

               <hi>but unto Cain and his offering, he had not reſpect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> He prefers the <hi>child</hi> before the <hi>father;</hi> he gives grace to the child, which he denieth the father; makes choice of the child, refuſeth the father.</p>
            <p>The Prophet ſaid of the wicked <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Son, <hi>All Iſrael ſhall mourn for him, for he only of Jeroboam ſhall come to the grave,</hi>

               <hi>becauſe in him there's found ſome good thing toward the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſometimes he chuſeth the Father, and paſſeth by the Child: he forgave <hi>Adam</hi> his ſin (though he damn'd the whole world) and caſt off <hi>Cain</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> God makes ſome ſharers in the <hi>ſame deliverance,</hi> who ſhare not in the <hi>ſame grace:</hi> as the <hi>ten Lepers,</hi> he gave them the <hi>ſame cure,</hi> not the <hi>ſame grace:</hi> he gave them <hi>all</hi> a cure, only to <hi>one grace: Were there not ten cleanſed? where are</hi>

            </p>
            <p>So the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> were all ſaved in the ſame <hi>Ark,</hi> and yet not all made partakers of the ſame Faith.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. The firſt work of grace in the ſoul is a gift: <hi>No man can come to me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>except it were given him from</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 6. 65. Rom. 5. 5.</note>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55699:30"/> we <hi>have</hi> grace: the grace of God, that we have grace <hi>from</hi> God.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>addition</hi> and <hi>increaſe</hi> of grace is a gift; every little degree of grace is a gift; and when he gives more, ſtill it is more gift.</p>
            <p>3. Heaven it ſelf is a gift: The gift of <hi>God is eternal life:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 27.</note> mark the whole verſe; <hi>The wages of ſin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eternal death is a wages, eternal life is a gift: men <hi>deſerve</hi> it, when they are damn'd: but they deſerve it not, when they are ſaved: their <hi>ſins</hi> are <hi>worthy</hi> of Death, but their <hi>graces</hi> are <hi>not worthy</hi> of Life; And the reaſon is,</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe mens ſins are their <hi>own,</hi> and therefore deſerve death.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Devil,</hi> ſaith, <hi>When he ſpeaketh a</hi>

            <p>2. Becauſe our ſins being <hi>perfectly ſinful,</hi> are worthy of death; but our graces being <hi>not perfectly gracious,</hi> are not worthy of life.</p>

            <p>I may rightly apply that Text to the Saints; <hi>Freely ye</hi>

            </p>
            <p>What is it to ſerve God freely?</p>
            <p>1. To count it a greater good to <hi>ſerve</hi> God, than to be <hi>ſaved:</hi> not as if a man ſhould not ſerve God with an eye to his ſalvation; for 'twere a ſin if he ſhould not, becauſe the <hi>recompence of reward</hi> is the great Promiſe; and 'twere a ſin not to prize, and eye, and look up to any promiſe of God; I ſay we are bound to ſerve God with an eye to the recompence of reward, becauſe it is the Promiſe of God; now we are to make
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55699:31"/> the <hi>beſt</hi> of every promiſe; to improve the promiſe, and to make the beſt advantage of it, for the quickning of our graces, and the cheering up of our ſpirits: The promiſes are <hi>helps,</hi> and we are bound to uſe all Gods Helps. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> we may ſet our ſalvation befor us, and aim at it.</p>
            <p>But yet (ſtill) this we ſhould do, (and if we ſerve God freely, will do it) <hi>count it a greater good</hi> to ſerve God, than to be ſaved; to glorifie God, than to be glorified.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Lord ſaith. <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour;</hi> This is his <hi>goodneſs;</hi> yet <hi>Gods</hi> Honour is a greater good than <hi>our</hi> honour: It is a greater good that <hi>God</hi> be glorified, than that <hi>we</hi> ſhould be glorified: becauſe the Glory of <hi>God</hi> is the good of the Creator; but <hi>our</hi> glory is but the good of the Creature.</p>
            <p>2. To ſerve God <hi>freely,</hi> is to ſerve him <hi>willingly:</hi> As we ſay of a man that doth a thing willingly, he doth it freely: for that is the very <hi>eſſence</hi> of the Will: that which is not done freely, is not done with the Will.</p>
            <p>Oh obſerve thy ſelf! Thou [Profeſſor] it may be prayeſt in thy cloſet, but if thou <hi>durſt</hi> omit it, thou wouldeſt not pray; thou art not drunk; but if thou durſt for ſhame, thou wouldeſt not be ſo temperate; now thou doſt not pray nor abſtain from ſin <hi>willingly</hi> and <hi>freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. To ſerve God <hi>freely,</hi> is to ſerve him <hi>abundantly:</hi> to be <hi>liberal</hi> in his ſervice: He that is no <hi>niggard,</hi> but is liberal in his gifts, we call him <hi>free:</hi> So he that ſerves God freely, is no niggard of his ſervice; he is very liberal of his ſervice to God: As we ſay of a man that's liberal of his Fare, and liberal in his Houſe; he is free, he cares not what he ſpends upon his friends; he provides bountifully for them; he calls for his Wines and Sweet-meats about him, and thinks nothing too much for them; we ſay this man hath a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> ſpirit: ſo the Saints that ſerve God freely, think they can <hi>never</hi> do enough for him: he makes abundant Proviſion to entertain Chriſt, and ſets a long Table full of Services, like ſo many diſhes before him.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Zachaeus, To day I muſt abide at thy</hi>

               <hi>houſe:</hi> How did <hi>Zachaeus</hi> entertain him? Wondrous liberally: ſaith he, <hi>Behold Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 8.</note>

            <p>A Saint cares not what he ſpends upon Chriſt; wilt thou have me give away one luſt? yea, ſaith Chriſt; there it is; another, ſaith Chriſt; there it is Lord, another yet, ſaith Chriſt; there 'tis Lord; nay all, ſaith Chriſt; take all then.</p>

Is grace a gift? then count thy <hi>work</hi> a gift: not a burden, but a gift; not a toyle, but a gift: look upon every labour, and every ſervice and obedience for God, as a gift: As a Woman, though ſhe travel in pain, yet counts her Child a gift from God: As the Text ſaith, <hi>Lo, Children are an heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55699:32"/> World is a ſtranger to aſſurance; this is ſuch a flower, as grows not in the Worlds garden; the world and aſſurance are <hi>Antipodes:</hi> And therefore if ever you would meet with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, do not as the <hi>world</hi> doth: For do ye not know, <hi>That narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it?</hi> And therefore you <hi>run from</hi> aſſurance, if you follow the world: Oh tremble then to go in the way of the world! If thou wilt follow the <hi>moſt,</hi> I tell thee, the moſt will be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Aſſurance lyeth <hi>East,</hi> and the world goeth <hi>Weſt;</hi> if thou follow the world, the Sun of aſſurance will ſet upon thee.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, That the <hi>Devil is the God of the world, who</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>hath blinded their minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he tells you, That the Saints are <hi>chaſtened of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 32.</note> 
               <hi>that they may not be CONDEMNED with the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where then can the world or her <hi>Children</hi> meet with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance? They may be aſſured of Hell, but not of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Our Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I pray not for the world, but for</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 17. 9.</note> 
               <hi>them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine:</hi> The Lord Jeſus doth not ſpend one breath to pray for the world; and where then is the aſſurance of the world?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is but a few ſpecial ones that wear the golden chain of aſſurance about their necks: and therefore you muſt be choice Chriſtians if you would have this <hi>white ſtone, and the new name written in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not every meaſure of <hi>true</hi> grace that affords aſſurance: ordinary Saints have it not; and therefore advance; Sirs, you muſt advance higher, you muſt be peculiar ones, if you would enjoy aſſurance: All the Children know not their Fathers ſecrets, but the choiceſt of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Aſſurance is a work of the <hi>greateſt diligence:</hi> And therefore ſaith <hi>Peter, Give all diligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lazy</hi> ſouls will never arrive at it: he that would have it, muſt be familiar and intimate with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Enoch,</hi> who was <hi>tranſlated,</hi> was one that <hi>walked with God;</hi> and you that would be tranſlated into the Heaven of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, muſt be perſons walking with God: You muſt take many a turn with him: you muſt dwell in his Preſence; you

To chuſe, God will reveal his Myſteries to the poor ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to the rich: not that he doth deſpiſe <hi>riches,</hi> but becauſe the <hi>rich</hi> deſpiſe him; they are proud of their riches, and think that God is <hi>engaged</hi> to ſave <hi>them</hi> above others, becauſe they are <hi>great</hi> above others: They that are rich in <hi>eſtate;</hi> are rich in <hi>conceit.</hi>

               <hi>Sol.</hi> Why not to thee? The Lord had as leif Trade with thee, as with any other.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles (many of them) were but <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> and yet the Lord Chriſt caught them in his Net: his ſpirit mov'd upon their Waters, and took them out of the depths of ſin, and revealed the glories of Heaven to them, ſo as to none ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after them.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fiſherman</hi> is as ordinary a <hi>Trade</hi> as any in the World, and yet Chriſt preferred them above all the World, and made them the greateſt men in Heaven and Earth; for himſelf ſits next the Father, and the Apoſtles next him.</p>
            <p>Dub. 3. <hi>But I am a</hi> Servant, <hi>an</hi> Apprentice, <hi>I am an</hi> Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, <hi>whoſe work is the meaneſt drudgery in the houſe, and will the Lord reveal to</hi> me <hi>the Myſteries of Heaven?</hi>

            <p>God is an humble God, and will ſit with the <hi>ſervant</hi> at the <hi>lower end</hi> of the Table, as well as with the Maſter at the upper end of the Table.</p>
            <p>Nay with God all are round Tables, there's no upper end; he reſpects not the <hi>Maſter</hi> more than the <hi>Servant,</hi> in matters<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 9.</note> of grace.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, I am but a ſervant, I ſit not down with my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at Table, I wait:</p>
            <p>So doth <hi>Free-grace,</hi> it waits too:</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were but Servants and Bondmen in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and yet God appeared to <hi>them,</hi> not to <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> Thou doſt the <hi>baſeſt ſervice</hi> in the houſe, and they made <hi>Brick,</hi> and yet God appeared to them, not to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>

               <hi>Joſeph</hi> was but a <hi>ſervant,</hi> and yet how <hi>familiar</hi> was God with him? It is worth your noting: <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a Servant all along. A ſervant to his Brethren, they ſold him (as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) into <hi>Egypt.</hi>

            <p>A man may be a ſervant to <hi>men,</hi> and yet not a ſervant to his <hi>luſts,</hi> and then God appears to thee:</p>

               <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he was caſt in the Priſon, was <hi>worſe</hi> than a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and yet God was with him there: God keeps company with <hi>Joſeph</hi> from <hi>ſervice</hi> to <hi>priſon,</hi> and gives him favour in the Jaylours eyes, and he truſts him with all his Priſoners: <hi>When men have command over their luſts, God gives them command over men.</hi>

            <p>Is it not time to awake, when <hi>ſalvation</hi> (like a Roſe) grows not in every ones garden? When the <hi>Beams of grace</hi> ſhine not

            <p>There were two Thieves crucified with Chriſt on the Croſs, the one is taken, the other left: Two Sons in <hi>Rebeccha's</hi> Womb, (<hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi>) the one is taken, and the other left. There were ten Virgins, five of them taken, and five left: Ah, Lord, how <hi>narrow</hi> is thy number!</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Miniſter is Preaching, the ſpirit, like an Archer, ſhoots the arrow of Converſion into ſuch an one's heart, and hits him, and paſſeth by many an one; he ſhoots his Arrow by ſo many, and hits one or two.</p>
            <p>Oh, how ſhould this awake you! Lord, hit <hi>my</hi> heart: Lord, make <hi>me</hi> thy mark; do not miſs <hi>my</hi> ſoul, but hit, Lord: I am an unclean wretch, make my black heart, thy <hi>white</hi> to ſhoot at: Lord, I am a drunkard, level thine Arrow of grace at my heart: ſhoot ſtedy, Lord, take thine aim, and ſhoot thy Darts through my deadly luſts.</p>
            <p>Lord, I am an unbeliever, I cannot believe the promiſe; take ſuch a word of pardon, and dart it into my ſoul, that I may believe.</p>
            <p>Lord, I have heard many Sermons, and thou haſt not hit me yet; I have ſate under the ſhowres of grace a long time, and every drop hath yet fallen beſides me: thine Arrows have fled about mine ears, and not one yet ſtuck in my ſides.</p>
            <p>Content not your ſelves then, in that ye live under the means of grace.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But is not this an</hi> hindrance <hi>to our converſion, a great block in our way, in that God gives grace to</hi> ſome, <hi>not to</hi> all? <hi>In that</hi> many are called, but few are choſen?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. No,</hi> none at all; nay it is a huge furtherance to grace and converſion, in that it is the gift of God.</p>
            <p>I think grace may <hi>ſooner</hi> be had, in that it is in <hi>Gods</hi> hand to give, than if it were in <hi>our</hi> power to <hi>get:</hi> Who would doubt of having grace from <hi>ſuch</hi> an hand? I ſay, from <hi>ſuch</hi> an hand, who hath <hi>ſuch</hi> a large and bounteous heart? And therefore if you ask, ſhould we not be <hi>more certain</hi> if our
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55699:37"/> ſalvation did depend on <hi>none</hi> but our ſelves.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, no: For we ought to be much more diſtruſtful of <hi>our ſelves</hi> than of <hi>God,</hi> who loves us <hi>more</hi> than we love our ſelves: And in a <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> caſe, 'tis better to commit our ſelves to the <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God, than to <hi>our own power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore I would demand of thee, Canſt thou ask for grace?</p>
            <p>Who ever went without grace, but 'twas <hi>his own</hi> fault? he <hi>had</hi> it not, becauſe he <hi>would not ſeek it:</hi> he went without it, becauſe he did <hi>not care</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But in that grace is the</hi> gift <hi>of God, and not in the</hi> diſpoſe <hi>of man; Is it not enough to</hi> take <hi>men</hi> off <hi>from duty and endeavour, and make them</hi> ſecure, <hi>and</hi> negligent <hi>of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſuch matter: For ſeeing on the one ſide, we cannot ſay, Grace ſhall be denied us; and on the other ſide, we are bound to <hi>Co-operate</hi> with grace, and <hi>work out our ſalvation;</hi> we ought therefore ſo to act [<hi>Ac ſi Gratia ſemper adeſſet</hi>] as if grace were always <hi>preſent;</hi> and yet ſo, as if the <hi>whole buſineſs</hi> lay in us: We ſhould walk between <hi>ſloth</hi> and <hi>pride: God</hi> is to be <hi>ſought</hi> and <hi>prayed to,</hi> as if the whole did depend upon him; and <hi>we</hi> muſt ſo act, as if the whole did depend upon us: We ſee this in Scripture, [<hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi>] as if the whole lay upon us; [<hi>For it is God that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you both to will and to do</hi>] as if the whole lay upon him.</p>

            <p>2. Thou makes a wrong uſe of this ſort of Doctrine in Scripture, [<hi>Many are called, but few are choſen: to you it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, to them
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55699:38"/> it is not given</hi>]: For this is ſet down in Scripture, not to feed thee with <hi>infidelity,</hi> but to terrifie thee from the fame, to <hi>ſtir</hi> thee up to believe; not to <hi>hinder,</hi> but to <hi>put thee on</hi> to believe, to make thee more careful to believe.</p>
            <p>3. As the <hi>command</hi> of believing reacheth to you, ſo doth the <hi>promiſe:</hi> The promiſe belongs to you all (though not the benefit of the promiſe; but only to ſo many as do believe), I ſay the promiſe belongs to you all.</p>
            <p>To clear this:</p>
            <p>1. See <hi>Heb. 4. 1, Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>left unto us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it</hi> (through unbelief).</p>
            <p>Mark the words, [<hi>there is a promiſe left unto us</hi>]; ſo doubt not but the promiſe belongs to thee; only beware thou <hi>come not ſhort of it</hi> through unbelief.</p>
            <p>Thou feareſt that the promiſe belongs not to thee; but the Apoſtle bids thee <hi>fear, lest a promiſe being left thee</hi> (or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to thee), thou <hi>come ſhort of it</hi> through unbelief.</p>
            <p>'Tis clear, That the <hi>promiſe is to thoſe, who come ſhort of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. So <hi>Acts 2. 39, Repent, and believe, for the promiſe is to</hi>

               <hi>you, and to your ſeed, and to all that are afar of, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi>

            <p>Mark here [<hi>the promiſe is to you</hi>] is laid down as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to believe; as a <hi>Motive</hi> to believe; and therefore did belong to them <hi>before</hi> they did believe: for the <hi>Cauſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes (you will ſay) <hi>to them,</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but not to us: mark the next words, [<hi>And to all that are afar of, even to as many as the Lord our God ſhall call</hi>]</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But God gives not Grace to</hi> all, <hi>and that's the thing that fears me.</hi>

            <p>The Covenant, is not only a Covenant <hi>to</hi> grace, but a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>of</hi> grace; not only a Covenant <hi>to</hi> grace, to give <hi>more grace</hi> where it is; but a Covenant <hi>of</hi> grace, to give grace where is <hi>none.</hi>

Then get upon ſome <hi>hill;</hi> the air of the lower region is thick and miſty: I mean, live above, abſtract your ſelves (as much as may be) from the world: God <hi>chuſeth</hi> his place to make Heaven: he makes Heaven <hi>above;</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is above: in ſouls that are above; above the vanities of this World, he makes an Heaven, and <hi>there</hi> the Myſteries of the Kingdom (like ſo many ſtars) ſhine.</p>

            <p>No man ſhall have two Heavens, or but very few.</p>

            </p>
            <p>God never proclaims himſelf <hi>well-pleaſed</hi> in that heart, which makes not <hi>him</hi> his pleaſure: A heart, and a heart hath none of <hi>Gods</hi> heart.</p>

            <p>We ſhall now give you the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Point, why it is that where there are beginnings of true grace, though never ſo weak, God makes rich additions of more grace: And,</p>

               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe, grace in a Saint is God's <hi>own child:</hi> the <hi>infant grace</hi> is the Spirits <hi>little babe,</hi> begot in the Womb of the ſoul, by the Spirit: the ſoul is the Mother of it, and the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is the Father of it: Now, you know, a Father is very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his young babe; he takes it up in his Arms, and looks upon it, he reads his own Image in it, and puts it in his boſom; he handles it as gently as ever he can, and preſerves it from the leaſt harm: So when the Infant-grace is born in the ſoul, the <hi>Spirit</hi> is very tender of his young babe; he makes won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous much of it, and is as Preſervative of its life, as ever he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55699:40"/> can: As you may ſee in <hi>Paul;</hi> he had been in <hi>ſore pangs</hi> of Travel three days and three nights together; and the child [<hi>Grace</hi>] was newly born, and ſee what care the <hi>Spirit</hi> had of it; ſaid he to <hi>Annanias, Ariſe</hi> [do not <hi>ſtay,</hi> ſaith he; but<note place="margin">Acts 9. 11.</note> ariſe] <hi>and go into the ſtreet which is called Straight, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in the houſe of Judas, for one called Saul of Tarſus: for behold, he prayeth:</hi> The child [<hi>Grace</hi>] as ſoon as it was born, began to cry, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> preſently takes care of it.</p>
            <p>1. The Spirit (when the ſoul is brought to bed, and ſafely delivered of her Man-child [<hi>Grace</hi>] ſets the little babe to nurſe, and provides ſuck for it, and gives it the Breaſts of the Ordinances; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>And I brethren, could not ſpeak</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 1 1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>unto you, as unto ſpiritual, but—as unto babes in Christ; I have fed you with milk:</hi> And [in 1 <hi>Pet. 2 2.] As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A babe, when 'tis new-born, muſt have milk, which is the moſt <hi>nutritive</hi> food in the world: ſo muſt the little new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when it is born, it muſt have milk; and therefore the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> provides it for him; The <hi>Ordinances</hi> are the Breaſts, and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> are the Nurſes which give it ſuck; As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We were gentle among you, even as a nurſe che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth</hi>

            </p>
            <p>2. The Spirit <hi>dades</hi> his little child [<hi>Grace</hi>] and teacheth it to go; As God ſaith, <hi>When Iſrael was a child, I loved him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 1. Verſe 3.</note> 
               <hi>and called my ſon out of Egypt—I taught Ephraim alſo to go, taking them by their arms.</hi>

               <hi>in the ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Spirit teacheth his little child [<hi>Grace</hi>] to ſpeak: as a Father (you know) takes up his little one upon his knee, and teacheth him to <hi>Articulate</hi> words, and to call [<hi>Dad</hi>]: ſo doth the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> teach the child [<hi>Grace</hi>] to cry, <hi>Abba,</hi>

            <p>He that <hi>gives,</hi> imitates <hi>God,</hi> who gives and receives not again, becauſe he <hi>wants</hi> not any thing: And therefore it was a ſaying of <hi>Chriſt, It is more bleſſed to give, than to receive:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 20. 35.</note> It is a part of <hi>Gods Beatitude,</hi> that he <hi>is</hi> all things, and <hi>hath</hi> all things to give; that he <hi>can</hi> give and not be <hi>beholden</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: that he is an <hi>overflowing</hi> Sea, <hi>always</hi> pouring out his gifts and golden ſtreams upon the Creature: When he hath given thee grace, he hath <hi>more</hi> grace ſtill to give: And being a God (and not man) he gives <hi>continually;</hi> to give, he makes his <hi>continued</hi> Act: He'l never ceaſe giving to his Saints, not only in this life, but in the life to come: he will be giving out unto his Saints <hi>eternally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Sun is always giving out its heat and virtue to the World, ſo will God be always giving out his ſweetneſs to his Saints throughout Eternity.</p>
            <p>So that, he that hath grace, ſhall have <hi>more</hi> grace: he that hath it in the bud, and in the beginning, ſhall have it in the perfection: fear not (poor creature) if <hi>thou</hi> art always <hi>want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God</hi> will be always <hi>giving;</hi> and being a God, he is not <hi>weary</hi> or <hi>remiſs</hi> in any of his Acts.

            <p>To give, is (as it were) an Act <hi>connatural</hi> to him, an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Act: he gave his <hi>Eſſence</hi> to his <hi>Son</hi> from all eternity, and<note place="margin">John 5. 26.

            <p>Oh, how happy a thing is it to have a ſoul ſeaſoned with

            <p>As a <hi>Limner,</hi> that intends a curious picture, at firſt makes but a <hi>rude Draught,</hi> and lays his dark Colours; but then by degrees he comes over with his beauteous and bright Colours, and draws out the perfect proportion of a curious piece: So <hi>God</hi> (that glorious Artiſt) in <hi>repairing</hi> man, intends ſome ſtately piece; he hath in his thoughts the <hi>Idaea</hi> of ſome glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious piece: Indeed 'tis <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that ſtands by him, after

            <p>Object. 2. <hi>But I cannot truſt God for the ſmalleſt matters: Food and Raiment are the ſmalleſt matters, and he that cannot truſt God in the leaſt matters (I fear me) hath a faith</hi> leſs <hi>than nothing.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt had many experiences of God Providence and Proviſion for them, they went about with Chriſt from place to place; and though they had no victuals, yet they found victuals every where; they ſaw ſo many <hi>thouſands</hi> ſed with ſo <hi>few loaves</hi>; and yet they were<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 30, 31.</note> troubled, <hi>What ſhall we eat? what ſhall we drink? and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhall we be cloathed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, thou ſeeſt, thy little grace may be true grace.</p>
            <p>2. God will <hi>own</hi> thy little grace: thy grace, though it be never ſo little, yet he will own it: As you may ſee in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 8, where writing to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Thou haſt a little ſtrength, and haſt ept my word:</hi> She had but a little ſtrength, and Chriſt takes greatnotice of her little ſtrength; <hi>Chriſt makes much of a little grace</hi>: As the Father <hi>dandles</hi> his little child, ſo Jeſus Chriſt dandles a little grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lap of his Commendation: Though thy grace be but low, yet he hath an high eſteem of it.</p>
            <p>3. God's giving ſome grace, engages him to give <hi>more</hi>: Hath God given thee a little grace? His giving thee that little, puts an engagement upon him to give thee more: one of his gifts bind him to give another.</p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:55699:44"/>
            <p>When God went about to deſtroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Shall I</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>Hide from Abraham that thing which I do, ſeeing I mean to make him a great and mighty nation?</hi> As though <hi>one</hi> kindneſs did bind him to give <hi>another</hi>: with God, the beſtowing of one favour binds him to add another.</p>
            <p>If God <hi>begin</hi> to give thee grace, he is engaged to go on, and give thee more grace, not for <hi>thy</hi> ſake, but becauſe 'tis his <hi>own</hi> work; and therefore if he ſhould not carry it on, he ſhould <hi>loſe</hi> what he had begun: If God hath pardon'd thee <hi>ſome</hi> ſins, and ſhould not pardon thee <hi>all the reſt,</hi> all his <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Pardons would be <hi>thrown away,</hi> like precious water ſpilt upon the ground: If God hath <hi>begun</hi> to give thee ſome grace, he is engaged to give thee more, for the ſake of the former; I ſay he is engaged to give thee more for the ſake of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and to give thee more yet; nay more yet, for the ſake of that grace that went before: As man that ploughs a piece of Land, counts himſelf engaged to ſow it; and if he ſow it, he counts himſelf engaged to fence it, and make it thrive; becauſe one work is for another, the former for the latter; plowing is for ſowing, and ſowing is for growing, and growing is for reaping, and therefore one labour calls for the help of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So when God puts a <hi>little</hi> grace into thee, it is for <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to bring on another, and that the former grace may not be in vain; one gift calls for the help of another.</p>
            <p>4. A <hi>little</hi> grace is a <hi>pledg</hi> of more: I ſay, the little grace thou haſt, is a ſure pledg of more; as a little piece of money is an <hi>earneſt</hi> of the whole ſum: God, ſpeaking of the effuſion of his gifts and graces, ſaith, <hi>I will pour out my ſpirit:</hi> God gives his <hi>ſpirit</hi> as freely as he gives rain: now (you know) firſt it rains ſmall drops, and after greater; and the ſmall are the ſigns of the great.</p>
            <p>5. Jeſus Chriſt makes interceſſion for a little grace: <hi>Peter,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I have pray'd that thy faith fail not</hi>: thou haſt but a <hi>little</hi> faith, and I have prayed for thy little faith, for thy weak faith, that it fail not: <hi>if any man ſin, we have an</hi>

               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:55699:44"/> 
               <hi>you to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to others it is not given,</hi> ſhould it not make thoſe tremble that have not the gift? that have not this ſpecial gift, <hi>To know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>? When our Lord ſaith, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given,</hi> ſhould it not ſhake the heart of the man that hath not ſo much as the <hi>firſt gift</hi> of grace yet beſtowed upon him? Sinner, thou haſt not ſo much as the Foundation, the firſt ſtone of the building yet laid in thee: Lord, what a ſad caſe am I in? whilſt thou art promiſing the <hi>addition</hi> of grace to others, thou haſt not planted ſo much as the <hi>beginnings</hi> of grace in me!</p>
            <p>1. While the ſaving-work in others is <hi>going on,</hi> it is not yet <hi>begun</hi> in thee: While others are upon their <hi>growth,</hi> thou art not yet <hi>born</hi>; I ſay, not <hi>born again.</hi> Sinner, thou haſt not yet ſo much as the <hi>firſt preparation</hi> of Heaven in thee, while others are upon their <hi>Progreſs</hi>; thou art not as yet in the <hi>Race,</hi> while others are running to the <hi>Gole</hi>: thou lyeſt <hi>dead,</hi> while others are <hi>raiſed</hi> and <hi>enlivened</hi>; thou haſt not yet <hi>ſet out</hi> toward Heaven, while others are a great way upon their Journey to Glory: thou art left ſleeping in <hi>Sodom,</hi> till the ſparks of fire and brimſtone fall down from Heaven, and fly about thine ears, while the <hi>Lots</hi> are carried out by the Angel of the Lord: Oh Sirs! ſee your miſery.</p>
            <p>2. Sinners, you are ugly and miſ-ſhapen Creatures without grace: you want the Image of God upon you: <hi>Holineſs</hi> is our comelineſs, and <hi>Grace</hi> is the only handſom garment: What are thy <hi>ſins</hi> but thy <hi>deformities?</hi> and thy <hi>luſts</hi> but thy <hi>lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi>? Thou careſt not what thou art in the eye of the godly; but careſt thou not what thou art in the eye of <hi>God?</hi> Thou feeſt no unhandſomneſs in ſin, thou ſeeſt not thy ſelf ugly, but art thou therefore the <hi>leſs</hi> ugly?</p>
            <p>A <hi>Toad</hi> or a <hi>Snake</hi> hath no odious apprehenſions of it ſelf; it is above their reach to apprehend what they are; ſo Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cannot diſcern their own deformities, their <hi>Judgments</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitions.</hi>

            <p>3. If Jeſus Chriſt doth not conquer you, <hi>he'l ſlay</hi> you: In <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 2, there ſaith <hi>John, I ſaw, and behold; a white horſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 6. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and he that ſate on him had a bow, and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Here <hi>John</hi> ſaw an <hi>horſe,</hi> which is myſtically the <hi>Goſpel</hi>;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55699:45"/> becauſe of its ſwiftneſs: The Apoſtles and Apoſtolical Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Primitive times, were Horſes, for their nimble and ſwift Preaching of the Goſpel through the World.</p>
            <p>2. This is a <hi>white horſe,</hi> to ſignifie,</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Purity</hi> of the Goſpel, or <hi>Divinity</hi> of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>2. to ſignifie the <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> it offers to the Sons of Men: it is called <hi>glad tidings,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel of peace:</hi> A white Flag is an Enſign of Peace.</p>
            <p>3. To ſignifie the <hi>Glory</hi> of Chriſt: <hi>white robes</hi> are Emblems of <hi>Glory:</hi> Princes and Nobles did go in white.</p>
            <p>4. To ſignifie the <hi>Triumph</hi> of Chriſt; <hi>white horſe</hi> in ſign of <hi>victory</hi> and Triumph.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> when they rid in Triumph, had white Horſes to ride on, or to draw their Chariots.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chriſt will <hi>get</hi> the day, he will <hi>triumph</hi> over ſouls, either in their ſubmiſſion or deſtruction: And therefore it is ſaid,</p>
            <p>3. That <hi>he that ſate on the white horſe, had a bow given him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Horſe-man,</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> had a bow in his hand, and a Bow preſuppoſeth arrows, that is, terrors, and threatnings againſt his Enemies, that will not ſubmit to his mercy; he hath his Arrow prepared upon the ſtring, and will ſhoot at the rebellious Sinner.</p>
            <p>It may be thou haſt ſome of Chriſt's Arrows ſticking in the ribs of thy Conſcience, and art wounded for ſome ſins; thy very heart is galled with the threatnings that fly (like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows) out of the Bow of the Miniſtry; but thou <hi>fretteſt:</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being <hi>converted,</hi> and falling at his feet, thou <hi>rageſt:</hi> Well, Chriſt rides on ſtill in the Chariot of his word, conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to conquer: one or other way conquer he will: if he cannot conquer thee with <hi>love,</hi> he'l kill thee in <hi>wrath:</hi> Thoſe that do <hi>yield,</hi> he <hi>ſaves;</hi> thoſe that <hi>will not,</hi> he <hi>ſlays.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Chriſt will Preach over all theſe Truths again in <hi>Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames</hi> to thee.</p>
            <p>Thou keepeſt thy ſins and luſts, and wilt by no means ſend them away; thou makeſt nothing of the Word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diſpenſed by <hi>Man:</hi> I tell thee, all the Sermons thou now heareſt againſt thy ſins, all the Truths of God ſhall one
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55699:45"/> day be Preach'd over again in flames of Fire to thine <hi>eternal horrour;</hi> and that will be a <hi>long</hi> Sermon.</p>
            <p>All the Sermons of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> thou heard'ſt here in thy life-time, ſhall in <hi>Hell</hi> be brought freſh to thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, thy <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſhall then Preach them all over to thee in Hell-flames, and then 'twil be a <hi>woful</hi> Sermon: Now the Sermon is but an hour long, look upon the <hi>glaſs,</hi> 'tis turned; and while the glaſs is running, we are Preaching, Preaching thee (if it be poſſible) into a ſtate of grace; this Sermon is but a ſhort Sermon, it will end anon; and while <hi>this</hi> glaſs is running, <hi>thy</hi> glaſs is running, and <hi>thy life</hi> is haſtening: but in <hi>Hell,</hi> there's no glaſs turned up; <hi>This,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> the Sermons thou ever heard'ſt, will there in flames be Preach'd over to thee again throughout eternity; Oh tremble at it! It will be a woful Sermon, and a long Sermon, 'twill <hi>never</hi> have an end.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. Grace at <hi>firſt</hi> is but little: An Infant, when 'tis new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, is but little: a Tree, when 'tis firſt planted, is but a little <hi>Graff:</hi> The Cloud that over-ſpreads the Heavens, was at firſt no bigger than a mans hand.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>But I am a Chriſtian of long ſtanding, and yet my grace is but little: Were I but a new beginner, 'twere ſomething: but I am a long stander, yet a ſhort Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Truly (<hi>my Beloved</hi>) blame thy ſelf then: chide thy ſelf that thou art a Chriſtian of a long ſtanding, and of a ſhort ſtature: It is a <hi>diſgrace</hi> to be ſo; as 'tis a diſgrace to be an old man, and yet a <hi>dwarf:</hi> Chriſt chides his Diſciples for it, though they were but of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> years ſtanding in his School; yet he chides them, becauſe they had ſo little<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 26.</note> Faith.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Thoſe that have leſs <hi>Grace,</hi> ſhall have <hi>leſs Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet I muſt ſay this much:</p>
            <p>2. That every thing in <hi>this life</hi> is but little: <hi>David</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 5.</note>

            </p>
            <p>3. Thou meaſureſt thy grace, with what thou <hi>ſhould'ſt be,</hi> and then it ſeems but little: A great deal of grace meaſured with what thou ſhould'ſt be, is but little: As <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith [<hi>Maxima eorum quae ſcimus, Minima eorum quae Ignoramus;</hi>] The much, nay moſt we know, is the leaſt of what we do not know: ſo the moſt we <hi>are,</hi> is the leaſt of what we <hi>ſhould be;</hi> the moſt we <hi>do,</hi> is the leaſt of what we <hi>ſhould do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great Saints are but little to what they <hi>ſhould be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Compare thy grace with times paſt, and then it may be it is not little; and that thou muſt do.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>But I have trifled away my time, the time I ſhould have</hi> got <hi>grace in;</hi> The Ant provides her meat in ſummer, and gathers her food in the harveſt: <hi>But I have ſpent my time of gathering, and is there any hope that I ſhall have more?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Humble thy ſelf: for 'tis a wondrous ſin to loſe time: becauſe we have but a time to glorifie God here: and by our loſing of <hi>time,</hi> God doth loſe his <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Yet, though thou haſt loytered away <hi>thy</hi> time, do not limit <hi>Gods</hi> time: becauſe thou haſt paſt away <hi>thy</hi> time, do not ſay, that <hi>Gods</hi> time is paſt.</p>
            <p>3. It may be thy time of growing is not come <hi>yet:</hi> As Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſome ſhoot up preſently, in their firſt years; others do not grow till they are ſixteen or twenty years, and theſe at laſt out-grow the others; ſome Saints grow more at firſt, others grow more at laſt.</p>
            <p>Trees bring forth their fruit in different ſeaſons, ſome ſooner, and ſome later.</p>
            <p>There is the firſt ripe fruit, and there is the latter fruit: ſome Trees have their fruit ripe and ready with the ſpring, others not till <hi>Auguſt,</hi> others not till <hi>Winter;</hi> there's the Summer-fruit, and there is the Winter-fruit: One tree goeth before, and hath her fruit ripe one month, another hath its fruit the next month, another follows and hath its fruit the next month after that.</p>

               <hi>How</hi> may we <hi>receive</hi> more grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Open thy ſoul to receive grace: For to <hi>receive</hi> a thing, is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55699:47"/> ſometimes a motion of the <hi>ſubject</hi> or <hi>faculty,</hi> opening it ſelf to receive it: As the hand doth open it ſelf to receive a gift; and a veſſel muſt be opened to receive oyl or cordial pour'd into it. <hi>The earht opened her mouth, and ſwallowed up Corah:</hi> And<note place="margin">Numb. 16. 32.

               <hi>the gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In love to grace promiſed: for love is an opening grace: When a man loves a friend dearly, he opens his Arms to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and receive him: ſo when a man loves grace, he opens his heart to welcom grace into it: And therefore ye ſhall find this paſſage between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Spouſe;</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Open to me my love;</hi> And ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>I roſe up to open to</hi>

            <p>He that <hi>loves</hi> Chriſt, will open the <hi>two-leav'd</hi> gates of his ſoul, to let in Chriſt with all his train.</p>
            <p>3. In deſire after grace promiſed: for the <hi>deſire</hi> of grace is an <hi>opening</hi> of the ſoul to <hi>receive</hi> grace: As the Lord ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 81. 10.</note>

            </p>
            <p>

            <p>God gives ſhowres of grace, where there's not a drop before.</p>
            <p>2. He can give grace to whom he will: he can love whom he will; and he can give grace to whom he will: this is the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of Gods Love, he can love <hi>any one: Man</hi> (being a narrow creature) <hi>cannot</hi> love any one; one that is <hi>fowl,</hi> and <hi>ugly,</hi> and <hi>crooked;</hi> but God can love any one, he can love <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom</hi> and <hi>deformed</hi> Creatures, and marry them, and make them <hi>lovely: Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> was a <hi>Leper,</hi> and therefore wondrous ugly, he was a <hi>Leper</hi> in <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Mind</hi> too: The beauty of the mind preſents a crooked perſon comely to us: but <hi>Naaman</hi> had beauty in <hi>neither</hi> part; he was a <hi>Leper</hi> in body, and an <hi>Idolater</hi> in mind; and yet God loved <hi>him,</hi> and (by a poor maid in his houſe) ſent him to the Prophet of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and healed his outſide, and healed his inſide, made his <hi>Body</hi> comely, and made his <hi>Soul</hi> comely.</p>

            <p>Some might have ſaid, Lord, they are <hi>oppoſers</hi> of thee, even to the Death; be it ſo, ſaith Chriſt; I have mercy for <hi>oppoſers too,</hi> and for <hi>perſecutors too; Father, forgive them, they know not what they do:</hi> But Lord, they do not beg for pardon, wilt thou give ſuch a kindneſs to them that <hi>ask</hi> not for it?

            <p>The <hi>Evangelical Hypocrite</hi> is he I aim at: There is <hi>Goſpel-Hypocriſie,</hi> ſo I call it: for where the Goſpel comes, there are two ſorts of Perſons that walk beſide it.</p>
            <p>1. Some directly oppoſe the Doctrine of it, and thoſe are <hi>Justitiaries,</hi> that ſet up their own Righteouſneſs, as the <hi>Jews</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 31, 32.</note> did.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>That Christ came to his own, and his</hi>

               <hi>own received him not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſuch are the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at this day, who are juſtly by our <hi>Divines</hi> ſaid to anſwer to the <hi>Jewiſh Phariſees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are <hi>Chriſtian Phariſees,</hi> they receive Chriſt in <hi>Name;</hi> but <hi>ſet up</hi> their own Righteouſneſs, and will be <hi>juſtified</hi> by their

            <p>2. Others there are, that receive the Goſpel, and ſo <hi>decry</hi> all their <hi>own Righteouſneſs,</hi> and cry up <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they ſee nothing in <hi>themſelves,</hi> and look for all from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> renouncing their own Righteouſneſs, and reſting upon <hi>Chriſt alone</hi> for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Theſe are of divers ſorts.</p>
            <p>1. Some receive Chriſt with an <hi>Hiſtorical, lifeleſs Faith:</hi> they believe in Chriſt, but will not part with their ſins: they gladly embrace Chriſt as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> but oppoſe <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and will not <hi>change</hi> their lives; and becauſe Chriſt came into the World to <hi>ſave ſinners,</hi> they take liberty to <hi>ſin,</hi> and hope to be ſaved as well as any: Theſe are thoſe we call our <hi>large Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> who are as great Enemies to Chriſt as <hi>Papiſts</hi> are.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> they will be ſaved <hi>by</hi> works <hi>without</hi> Faith, theſe will be ſaved <hi>by</hi> Faith <hi>without</hi> works. Theſe are <hi>ſpots in our feaſts;</hi> The <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were written as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes againſt this kind of poyſon.</p>

            <p>Men that have their feet or their arms ſcalded, will put them into cold water which gives them eaſe, though it gives them no cure; yet, becauſe it gives them eaſe, there they keep them: So men, whoſe Conſciences are ſcalded with wrath; Oh! now the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification</hi> by Faith in Chriſt is very ſweet: And ſo they are <hi>eaſed</hi> by it, never <hi>cured</hi> by it; and therefore you ſhall find them <hi>diſclaim</hi> all works, and <hi>cry up</hi> grace only; when Chriſt is offered, and general notice given them, that there is <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> for <hi>great Sinners,</hi> this fills them with <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But wherein doth theſe mens hypocriſie appear?</p>
            <p>They receive Jeſus Chriſt only for eaſe: I ſay, a falſe heart receives Chriſt only to eaſe him, to eaſe him of the terrour of Conſcience, and to eaſe him of the work of Obedience. And here prophane Sinners find great eaſe: The weight of their guilty Conſciences would preſs and ſink them down, but that they bear up upon the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: Oh! he dyed for Sinners, and paid our debt, and now they are cheerful and eaſie: they can ſin, and be eaſie; follow their drunkenneſs, and be eaſie; ſwim in their uncleanneſs, and be eaſie; for they make the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt their Bladder to ſwim upon; and ſay what you will to them, they will not ſink.</p>
            <p>If you ask one of theſe drunkards, and haters of the Saints, and railers at godlineſs; I ſay, if you ask them, Do you believe in Chriſt? yes, ſay they: Believe, yea, we believe exceedingly: and ſo they do: the truth is, they believe beyond meaſure: but they believe and reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt, to eaſe themſelves of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they cannot but ſee the want of it, and they cannot eaſe themſelves, but by pleading, that Chriſt is holy, and that though <hi>they</hi> have it not, yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath it: This is a great eaſe to their thoughts at the preſent; and thus they receive Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Oh Sirs! that you would conſider the ſad condition of this man, whoſe plagues ſhall be made wonderful, whoſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſuits him ſtill for ſin, and then looks up to Chriſt, and reſts there; and hears Sermons, but then ſalves up all with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and conſiders often that his <hi>ways</hi> are evil, but never ſuſpects his <hi>faith</hi> to be evil: Then he is taken with Death, and then looks up to Chriſt; at laſt the ſnuff dyes, and his Sun ſets, and darkneſs approacheth, and then inſtead of <hi>heaven</hi> embraceth <hi>flames:</hi> and what is it that hath deceived
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55699:50"/> theſe men? Oh! their <hi>Faith</hi> hath deceived them: they <hi>believed</hi> they might have had <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> too: and then in Hell they wiſh, Oh! that I had <hi>conſidered,</hi> and <hi>feared</hi> this before: and will you not fear now?</p>
            <p>I charge you then, think not your Eſtates <hi>good,</hi> becauſe you reſt on Chriſt, and look for ſalvation by <hi>him only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There are others who receive Jeſus Chriſt not only into their belief, but into their boſoms; not only into their heads, but alſo into their hearts: They have a great work upon them, the Goſpel doth not only <hi>Irradiate</hi> their minds, but alſo (in a great meaſure) <hi>Captivate</hi> their Wills: they have <hi>affections</hi> to Chriſt, and ſweet motions to holy things kindled in their hearts: <hi>They receive the word with joy and delight;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> they fall into raptures of love to, and admiration of Jeſus Chriſt; they do not only <hi>aſſent</hi> to the Doctrine of <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by Chriſt, but are made partakers of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> There is a change wrought in them, they ſeem to be <hi>waſhed</hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi>] live very near one another, if they be not really the <hi>ſame:</hi> ſome ſay, they are but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame power</hi> or <hi>faculty</hi> of the ſoul, and ſo there is a <hi>real Identity</hi> of the Will and Underſtanding; ſaying, that the <hi>Will</hi> is <hi>Intellectus extenſus;</hi> others affirm, that they are faculties really <hi>diſtinct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However it is by all concluded, that there muſt (in order of nature) be <hi>light</hi> before <hi>choice, knowledg</hi> before <hi>election;</hi> the Intellectual creature muſt ſee, before it can determine or reſolve upon.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay, the <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>unſound</hi> reſolution of the ſoul flows from defect of <hi>light:</hi> The hypocriſie of the heart ſprings from the want of a ſaving Illumination in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>This appears in the Parable of the <hi>Virgins,</hi> of whom the Lord Chriſt ſaith, That <hi>five were wiſe, and five were fooliſh:</hi> The vanity of the one ſprang from their folly; the proviſion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55699:51"/> of Oyl the others made, ſprang from their Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>You know it's frequent in <hi>Solomons Proverbs,</hi> to call the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and godly man, the <hi>wiſe man;</hi> the ſinner and hypocrite, the <hi>fool;</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of ſin lyeth in the power of <hi>darkneſs:</hi> The ſtrength of a State, in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of its Council.</p>
            <p>1. The Underſtanding is the firſt inlet of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Grace:</hi> this is that which opens and ſhuts to all life and ſin.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Satan</hi> laid his <hi>Train</hi> and <hi>Powder-plot</hi> to blow up all the World by the ſin of one man, he firſt enters into diſpute with <hi>Eve,</hi> and (as the Apoſtle ſaith) deceived her; <hi>The woman was deceived,</hi> and ſo darkned her mind with a miſt:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 14.</note> the <hi>ſerpent</hi> crept into her heart through the door of her <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There could no ſin get into the <hi>Will,</hi> were there not an error firſt in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And as the <hi>mind</hi> is the firſt inlet into ſin, ſo it is the firſt door that lets in <hi>grace: Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 17. 17. John 12. 35.</note> 
               <hi>word is truth: Walk while you have the light, leſt darkneſs come upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Satan knew, if <hi>light</hi> came in, <hi>Christ</hi> would come in.<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Divine light is very powerful: it hath a mighty influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>change</hi> and <hi>renew the</hi> heart. <hi>We all with open face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory as by the ſpirit of the Lord:</hi> All Divine light of glory works ſtrongly: if hypocrites had it, their hearts would be <hi>ſincere:</hi> Not that bare light can <hi>change</hi> the will, but the Lord works by it: When the Lord comes with <hi>life,</hi> he comes with <hi>light. Awake thou that ſleepeſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the ſpirit comes, all his work is expreſſed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, of <hi>ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment:</hi> convince one effectually, and you convert him: <hi>You ſhall know the truth</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 8. 32.</note> (ſaith Chriſt), <hi>and it ſhall make you free;</hi> that is, from your bondage of ſins, you ſhall be ſet at liberty.</p>
            <p>I ſay, all hypocriſie ſprings from ſome want of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine light: The <hi>young man</hi> ſaw <hi>ſome</hi> worth in Chriſt, but not <hi>enough,</hi> and therefore forſook Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A man may ſee the Lord Jeſus in the letter of the Scripture, which though it be neceſſary to the ſaving Knowledg of Chriſt; yet to ſee the Lord Jeſus no otherwiſe than in the letter, by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55699:51"/> the ſtrength of Fancy and Underſtanding, this is no ſaving Knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Between the <hi>palpable ignorance</hi> of Chriſt without the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the <hi>ſaving</hi> Knowledg of Chriſt in the Goſpel, there is this <hi>middle</hi> Knowledg of Chriſt, which is <hi>literal,</hi> whereby a man doth ſee; yet in ſeeing, ſeeth not.</p>
            <p>Now ſaving Illumination,</p>
            <p>1. It is a peculiar Illumination: The greateſt Scholar that ever lived, never had one ſuch thought or apprehenſion of the Lord, and the things of the Lord, as the Saints have: To them the Lord reveals ſome things that the wiſeſt in the world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew.</p>
            <p>2. It is a glorious and ſhining Illumination.</p>
            <p>1. They behold a Glory in Chriſt's <hi>perſon:</hi> the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his <hi>hidden</hi> glory to them, ſuch as never entred into their hearts before, or into the minds of other men; which, though others may talk and diſcourſe of, yet they cannot ſee it in that manner as they do: It is therefore called a <hi>marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>John</hi> 1. 14. They ſaw Chriſt <hi>vailed</hi> in our <hi>Humane</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and darkned under the Cloud of a <hi>mean</hi> condition; And yet <hi>they beheld his glory, as of the only begotten of the</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> ſaw the <hi>ſame Chriſt,</hi> yet could not ſee the <hi>ſame Glory</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>2. They behold a glory in the <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt: his graces ſtrike a Majeſty of him in their hearts: Oh that I were like him!</p>
            <p>3. They behold a glory in his <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promiſes:</hi> Oh, that all thoſe promiſes might be made good to me! this is all my deſire.</p>
            <p>4. They behold a glory in all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Chriſt: <hi>Oh</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 1. Verſ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>God! my ſoul thirſteth for thee—To ſee thy power and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the ſanctuary. How amiable</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 84. 1. Verſ. 10.</note> 
               <hi>are thy Tabernacles, Oh Lord of hoſts! A day in thy court is better than a thouſand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh the fellowſhip of Saints! Oh the luſtre and beauty of his Sabbaths!</p>
            <p>5. They behold a glory in the <hi>Commands</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of Chriſt:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55699:52"/> Oh, if once I could in every thing give content to his heart! Such a ſoul had rather <hi>loſe</hi> all, than <hi>croſs</hi> his <hi>Will</hi> in a ſmall thing: he ſeeth a glory in the <hi>leaſt truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. They ſee a glory in all his <hi>Diſpenſations:</hi> Have I but a <hi>little</hi> eſtate? This is the <hi>allowance</hi> he provides for me: <hi>I am leſs than the least of all thy mercies:</hi> His glory therefore appears, that I have a <hi>bit of bread to eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. They behold a glory in the <hi>Croſs</hi> of Chriſt; glory in all their <hi>ſufferings:</hi> I am not <hi>worthy</hi> to ſuffer ſhame for the name of Chriſt: <hi>Moſes</hi> eſteemed the <hi>reproaches of Christ</hi> greater riches than the <hi>Treaſures of Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall find a <hi>falſe heart</hi> ever fall ſhort here.</p>
            <p>3. It is a ſoul-humbling Illumination: One every way ſo fit and ſuitable to them, according to all their wants and woes; ſo far in Splendour and Majeſty ſurpaſſing their unworthineſs, and yet laying his <hi>greatneſs</hi> flat at the feet of their neceſſities and miſeries; that when the ſoul doth ſee it, it uſually fills the head, and heart, and eyes with tears: Oh, that I have deſpiſed <hi>him</hi> ſo glorious!<note place="margin">Acts 2. 36, 37.</note>
            </p>
            <p>4. It is an endearing and attractive Illumination.</p>
            <p>Sinners may (like <hi>Balaam</hi>) ſee the glory of the Tents of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and the <hi>Star of Jacob;</hi> but they <hi>eſteem</hi> him not in all his glory.</p>
            <p>Many reprobates under a lively Miniſtry, may ſee <hi>ſome</hi> glory in Chriſt, and in his Saints; to think them the happy men, yet not <hi>esteem</hi> of him in all his glory.</p>
            <p>The damned in Hell ſee a glory in Chriſt, elſe they would never <hi>grieve</hi> for the loſs of him; yet they cannot <hi>love</hi> him, nor <hi>rejoyce</hi> in his glory.</p>
            <p>But the light the Saints have of him, makes Chriſt tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in their eyes, and precious in their hearts: they eſteem him beyond ten thouſand Worlds.</p>
            <p>3. But yet further; The <hi>ſecret Goſpel-hypocrites</hi> have not hearts <hi>effectually</hi> to uſe and improve the <hi>means</hi> unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Salvation</hi> is the great <hi>end</hi> they would have; but they come ſhort in the <hi>uſe</hi> of means; they draw not the Arrow to the head; they drive not home enough in the uſe of means.</p>
            <p>The <hi>cloſest</hi> hypocrites diſcover themſelves in an <hi>ineffectual</hi> uſe of the means unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Men out of the Church, they periſh becauſe they have no
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55699:52"/> 
               <hi>remedy,</hi> no <hi>ſaving</hi> means to help: But why do thoſe periſh that are <hi>within</hi> the Church? Is it becauſe there <hi>is</hi> no remedy? No: but becauſe they do not <hi>uſe</hi> the remedy: Is it becauſe they <hi>want</hi> means? No; but becauſe they do not <hi>effectually improve</hi> the means: <hi>Here</hi> they fall ſhort, herein they diſcover themſelves.</p>
            <p>Sirs, There is a <hi>Spirit</hi> of ſloath and ſlumber which the Lord ever leaves the beſt hypocrite unto: The laſt Enemy God conquers in a man is his <hi>ſloath:</hi> Now this hangs upon the moſt <hi>refined</hi> hypocrite to the end: he will Act, but 'tis remiſly in order to ſalvation: he'l <hi>not</hi> act at all, or will not act <hi>throughly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Parable of the <hi>Talents,</hi> one of the ſervants was caſt<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 24, 25.</note> away, Why ſo? becauſe he had <hi>no</hi> Talent? No; but becauſe he had no <hi>mind,</hi> nor <hi>liſt</hi> to <hi>uſe</hi> his Talent: he was idle, and did not make his gain out of it, to attain his end; And therefore the Lord ſaith unto him, [<hi>Thou wicked and ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 26.</note> 
               <hi>ſervant</hi>].</p>
            <p>My Beloved, all the Ordinances of God, and all that time we have under them, are <hi>Talents:</hi> Now wherein do hypocrites <hi>fail?</hi> There is a ſecret gain of Ordinances which hypocrites regard not.</p>
            <p>Why have many ſouls ſet a great price upon Chriſt, and yet have loſt him, and gone without him? Becauſe like indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>chapmen,</hi> they have had a <hi>deſire</hi> to the Commodity, but have been <hi>loth</hi> to be at the full coſt for him.</p>
            <p>The Lord ſets before you the <hi>highest</hi> and moſt <hi>glorious end,</hi> but 'tis through <hi>many difficulties</hi> that we muſt arrive at it; now there being a <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Security and ſloth within, and thoſe dfficulties without; a hypocrite <hi>ſits down</hi> and <hi>reſts</hi> under the ſhadow of his negligence; and ſaith, <hi>'Tis hard;</hi> and becauſe he cannot do ſo, he hopes 'tis but an <hi>infirmity,</hi> and God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his <hi>deſires.</hi> And here he periſheth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (you know) were bound for <hi>Canaan,</hi> they aimed at it; but when their <hi>ſpies</hi> had told them of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their ſpirits ſunk within them, only <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah</hi> had upright hearts, <hi>and followed the Lord fully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>ſpiritual</hi> merchants do prize and earneſtly deſire the Treaſures of Heaven, here's their <hi>end:</hi> But to be at the coſt to prepare a <hi>Ship,</hi> to embark upon the trouble of an <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyage</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55699:53"/> to fetch this Treaſure, to ſail through a dangerous Sea of <hi>Temptations,</hi> through <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>good</hi> report, through the <hi>powers</hi> of darkneſs, through the <hi>oppoſitions</hi> of the World, and the <hi>contradictions</hi> of a ſinful and unbelieving heart; to lanch from one <hi>depth,</hi> and <hi>wave</hi> to another: This the beſt hypocrite fails in, and loſeth all at laſt.</p>
            <p>My Beloved, here you may ſee the root of all the <hi>complaints</hi> that are in the mouths of many Profeſſors, they are ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining and crying out of <hi>wants,</hi> but never feel <hi>ſupplies;</hi> ever <hi>confeſſing</hi> their ſins, but never <hi>triumphing</hi> over their ſin; ever <hi>hoping,</hi> never <hi>having;</hi> ever <hi>wiſhing</hi> that they <hi>had</hi> the Lord, but never <hi>enjoying</hi> the Lord: Why? what's the cauſe of this? Is heaven ſo <hi>barren,</hi> that there are no golden mines there? Are the fields of Gods Ordinances ſo <hi>empty,</hi> that there is no <hi>treaſure</hi> to be found there? Surely no: Gods Store-houſes and Granaries are full, but Chriſtians are lazy; there <hi>is</hi> the Treaſure, but they <hi>cannot,</hi> or <hi>will not dig</hi> for it: <hi>If thou cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi>

               <hi>after knowledg, and lifteſt up thy voice for underſtanding: If thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her, as for hid treaſures: Then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledg of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men pray againſt ſin, and if a few <hi>ſighs</hi> will fetch in ſtrength, well and good; if not, they caſt that <hi>ſhovel</hi> by, <hi>Dig I cannot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſpend ſome time in mourning, and laying ſin to heart; but if they cannot <hi>preſently</hi> feel the bitterneſs of it, I cannot help it (ſay they) <hi>Dig I cannot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You complain, you <hi>ſeek</hi> and <hi>find not;</hi> but do you <hi>ſeek dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently? He that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that</hi>

            <p>You complain that your hearts are fugitive and wandring, undiſpoſed to what is good.</p>
            <p>But I pray you, Do you <hi>keep</hi> them <hi>with all diligence?</hi> Are you at <hi>pains</hi> to keep your hearts? There, there it lyeth, you are <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>ſlothful,</hi> you love not to <hi>ſit up</hi> and <hi>watch</hi> your hearts.</p>
            <p>

            <p>You complain you meet not with aſſurance: but you can
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55699:53"/> live well enough without it, and make up the want of it with other comforts: Your <hi>contentments</hi> in the world make up the abſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from you, and is not this a <hi>neglect</hi> of him? Yet you complain you want aſſurance, but do you uſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt coſt and care to <hi>make it ſure?</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Give all diligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! come then and examine your ſelves by this rule: Tell me, you poor Creatures, Do you not often find checks for ſin, deſires againſt it; <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> weeping at your knees, and your hearts <hi>almoſt</hi> perſwaded? Do you not find ſome movings towards the Lord, but yet withall a <hi>dead, ſloathful</hi> heart ſtays you again, and will not let you offer violence to your ſelves?</p>
            <p>4. An hypocrite, his turning from ſin, is but an <hi>exchange</hi> of <hi>one</hi> ſin for <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many will ſay unto me, I am no hypocrite; for I have left theſe, and thoſe dear luſts which pleaſed me very well: My drunkenneſs pleaſed me, but I have left it; my carnal mirth was my daily Cordial, but I have thrown away the Cup and ſpilt it; I was an oppreſſour and dealt unjuſtly, but I have left it off: Well, this is well done; but haſt thou entertained <hi>no other</hi> ſin in the ſtead of it?</p>
            <p>I tell you, An hypocrite his turning from ſin, is but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of one ſin for another: When <hi>one</hi> ſin is caſt away, <hi>another</hi> ſteps in the room of it; and when <hi>that</hi> is gone, <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſupplies the place of that too; and commonly the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> ſin and temptation is the laſt.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe his <hi>Nature</hi> is not changed.</p>
            <p>The ſin of <hi>Nature</hi> only is moſt properly the <hi>reigning</hi> ſin.</p>
            <p>It hath been a Queſtion, What is a mans <hi>reigning</hi> ſin? his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-ſin?</hi> But no ſin is able to <hi>reign</hi> over any man, but by Commiſſion and Power from his ſin of Nature: As the weeds can never grow tall, but by virtte of their ſoyl where they grow: All the Boughs flouriſh by virtue of the root on which they grow; And therefore we ſhall ſee, let Satan ſow his ſeeds of pride, or luſt, or paſſion in a man whoſe <hi>nature</hi> is changed, 'tis impoſſible they ſhould come to any perfection there; but they will dye away within a time, becauſe the <hi>heart</hi> of the ſoyl is gone.</p>
            <p>Hence alſo it comes to paſs that a mans <hi>Maſter-ſin</hi> may be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55699:54"/> changed: Thoſe ſins that are his Maſter-ſins in his youth, are not in his old age; thoſe that are at one time, in one place, are not in another.</p>
            <p>Now there could never be ſuch change of <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Vice-roys,</hi> unleſs there were ſome <hi>great King</hi> that ſets up one, and pulls down another, <hi>Satis pro imperio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore is the reigning ſin, which pulls down <hi>one</hi> ſin, and ſets up <hi>another</hi> under it, which gives ſtrength to every ſin.</p>
            <p>Now a gracious change is a <hi>full</hi> change; not only a change, but a full change; not only a Converſion (for an hypocrite may be converted) but a full Converſion: 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah, That he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 25.</note> 
               <hi>but not with a PERFECT HEART: Judah turned to</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Jer. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord, but not with her whole heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, you ſee hypocrites may be converted: There may be a turning to the Lord, but not a <hi>whole</hi> turning: there are many that have a Converſion, but not a <hi>full</hi> Converſion.</p>
            <p>What is a <hi>full</hi> Converſion?</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a deep Converſion.</item>

            <p>1. It is a deep Converſion; it ſtrikes at the <hi>root,</hi> and ſubdues the very <hi>natural</hi> corruption; I ſay, more or leſs it kills the natural corruption, and ſo by degrees ruinates the very <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of ſin: ſo that in true Converſion, <hi>nature</hi> it ſelf is ſlain, <hi>I mean corrupt nature;</hi> it <hi>dyes</hi> and <hi>rots</hi> like a root in the earth; and in this, the <hi>ſuperficial</hi> Converſion falls ſhort.</p>
            <p>That you may underſtand it, you muſt know, there are <hi>two</hi> corruptions of Nature:</p>

            </list>
            <p>The <hi>natural</hi> depravation is expreſſed by <hi>David, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in iniquity;</hi> and in that of <hi>Job, Who can bring a clean thing out of filthineſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>acquired</hi> Corruption of Nature is expreſſed in that Text, <hi>All fleſh had corrupted his ways.</hi> From the <hi>natural</hi> Corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion proceeds the <hi>acquired,</hi> and by the <hi>acquired,</hi> the <hi>natural</hi> corruption is <hi>inflamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>natural</hi> corruption cannot be <hi>repaired</hi> but by <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>regeneration.</hi>

            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:55699:54"/>
            <p>The acquired Corruption of Nature was got by <hi>cuſtom</hi> and <hi>habit,</hi> and ſo it may be loſt by habit.</p>
            <p>A man may free himſelf from his acquired Corruptions, he may by <hi>care</hi> and <hi>induſtry</hi> of his own, mortifie his <hi>acquired</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations of Nature.</p>
            <p>As we read of many, <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> who by their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Induſtry freed themſelves from the ſlavery of many <hi>ſenſual appetites</hi> and <hi>paſſions,</hi> which their <hi>corrupt nature</hi> and <hi>evil company</hi> had led them into, and yet the <hi>natural</hi> corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remained ſtill.</p>
            <p>Thou thinkeſt thou art <hi>converted,</hi> becauſe thou haſt <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> thy <hi>drunkenneſs;</hi> but drunkenneſs is but an <hi>acquired</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, thou didſt get it by <hi>cuſtom,</hi> and mayſt <hi>break</hi> it by <hi>custom,</hi> and yet <hi>nature</hi> remain ſtill unchanged.</p>
            <p>5. The change of the <hi>heart</hi> chiefly appears in the change of the <hi>ultimate</hi> or <hi>utmoſt end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Pollution of the whole man, and all his Actions, Moral, Civil, and Religious, conſiſts chiefly, and appears in ſeeking <hi>ſelf,</hi> or making <hi>our ſelves</hi> our <hi>utmoſt</hi> end; ſo our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification lyeth in this, and appears chiefly in making <hi>God</hi> the <hi>ultimate</hi> end of all we do.</p>
            <p>A man before he is ſanctified, deſires <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> only to keep his <hi>ſores</hi> from <hi>aking:</hi> for ſo I look upon all men made up of wants; if the <hi>body</hi> ake with diſeaſes and pains, the <hi>ſtomack</hi> with hunger, <hi>conſcience</hi> for ſin; all their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lyeth in the <hi>eaſing</hi> thereof, here lyeth their bliſs: They ſeek after <hi>God</hi> only as a Phyſitian to heal or cure them, but not as the <hi>end</hi> of their cure: The ſick man ſends for the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,</hi> but his health and recovery is his <hi>end;</hi> ſo do men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Converſion, in their pangs of Conſcience, their afflictions, their wants and neceſſities; they ſeek to God, and make uſe of God as an <hi>inſtrument,</hi> but their <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts</hi> are their <hi>ends: Jehu</hi> ſought the Lord, but his <hi>laſt end</hi> was <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the heart is <hi>ſanctified,</hi> then <hi>God</hi> is their <hi>end;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their luſts and ſins, God is the only end in their eye; inſtead of the riches or comforts of the World, God is the Object in their eye: <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and</hi>

            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55699:55"/>
            <p>1. The ſoul ſeeth <hi>its own vileneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> in his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: This is the firſt Principle of ſeeking the Lord: the ſoul ſeeth all his good laid up in the <hi>Lord,</hi> more than in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; nay <hi>wholly</hi> in the Lord, <hi>not at all</hi> in himſelf: <hi>All my ſprings</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>are in thee:</hi> All my treaſures of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> all my riches of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> they are all in thee; and therefore the Saints, when they ſee their own <hi>vileneſs,</hi> and the Lord in his <hi>Glory,</hi> are ſo far from <hi>ſeeking,</hi> that they <hi>loath</hi> themſelves.</p>
            <p>2. The ſoul ſlights the creatures, as veſſels of <hi>meer vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh try your ſelves then by this touchſtone!</p>
            <p>A carnal heart may croſs his own <hi>Will,</hi> but not his own <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man may ſeek the Lord with delight, and follow the<note place="margin">Zech. 7. 5, 6. Iſa. 58. 4, 5.</note> Ordinances, and faſt, and pray, but <hi>himſelf</hi> is his <hi>end ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How ſhall we know we make God our <hi>end?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. When you make him your happineſs: thoſe that are throughly ſanctified, make the Lord their <hi>last end</hi> and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: <hi>Happy art thou, O Iſrael; who is like unto thee, O</hi>

               <hi>people! Happy are thoſe people, whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The full reſt and peace of the ſoul is to be found only in the Preſence of <hi>God,</hi> in this Being of Beings: his perfections are in <hi>himſelf,</hi> he keeps a perpetual <hi>ſabbath</hi> of reſt in himſelf: And in <hi>this</hi> reſt only the gracious ſoul ſeeks <hi>his</hi> reſt; God is the journeys-end of all his Labours, Life, and Travels.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Solomon</hi> had tyred out himſelf in his Travels through all the things of this World, at laſt he returns empty and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home; and now when he ſums up all his Glory, he ſaith, <hi>The words of the preacher the Son of David, King in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>

            <p>He ſtiles himſelf,</p>
            <p>1. A man gathered to the Church, to be as near God as he can.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Son of David,</hi> to whom the promiſes were made.</p>
            <p>And then thirdly, <hi>King of Jeruſalem,</hi> the leaſt and laſt of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When you do the Lords work purely for the Lord: the Hypocrite will do the Lords work, but 'tis, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his own Intereſts are bound up with it. As a man that

            <p>But the gracious heart will go for God, and ride for God, meerly upon the Lords occaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When you carry all things down the ſtream to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God: As a River running toward the Sea, many ſprings fall and run into it, but it carrieth them down all with it; ſo the upright ſoul, there are many occaſions, hinderances, buſineſſes, but he carrieth them <hi>all</hi> down along with him; they muſt all go with him, they ſhall not divert him, but he will over-maſter them, and lead them his way; nay the more he is hindred, the more violent is his motion; <hi>It is time for thee, O Lord, to work, for they have made void thy</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Therefore they that are ſanctified, love the Lord fully, that is above all.</p>
            <p>A man is highly endeared to that which he makes his end: his <hi>end</hi> commands his <hi>affections:</hi> to <hi>love</hi> the Lord, and to be <hi>beloved</hi> of the Lord, and behold his Glory, is the <hi>main end</hi> of the upright heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They that are ſanctified, dedicate themſelves to the <hi>Will</hi> of God; I mean to the whole Will of God: <hi>Their</hi> will is emptied into his will: <hi>Teach me to do thy will,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for an <hi>holy man,</hi> is a <hi>conſecrated man,</hi>

               </note> a man ſeperated from <hi>common</hi> to a <hi>Divine</hi> uſe.</p>
            <p>The ſanctified man, is a man ſeparated from <hi>his own</hi> will, and ſet apart to <hi>do Gods</hi> Will; he is gone out of his own Will, and lives at a diſtance from it; he is ſorry that he hath ſerved his own will ſo long, and is weary of the ſervice.</p>
            <p>1. They that are ſanctified, do Gods Will, purely becauſe it is <hi>his</hi> will; becauſe it <hi>pleaſeth</hi> him: there is a dear propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in the Saints to do Gods Will, becauſe it <hi>pleaſeth</hi> him. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord unto ths Eunuchs that keep my ſabbaths,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 56. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and chuſe the things that pleaſe me:</hi> This is their <hi>choice,</hi> it is in their hearts to do it, becauſe it <hi>pleaſeth the Lord: I will</hi>

            <p>This is the <hi>Motive</hi> and loadſtone of their Obedience, in that it <hi>pleaſeth</hi> him: This is the <hi>joy</hi> of their work, and that which makes <hi>muſick</hi> upon the ſtrings of their hearts, becauſe it <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi> him.</p>
            <p>It is with every man, as it was with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> he would needs have a wife of the <hi>Philiſtins;</hi> Why ſo? becauſe <hi>ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi>

               <hi>me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So why do men ſeek themſelves, love themſelves, and eſpouſe theſe and thoſe luſts, but becauſe it pleaſeth them: Look then, as the ſoul, when he loved himſelf, did ſeek to pleaſe only his own will in every thing and 'twas good, becauſe it <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> him; ſo the Saint, whoſe heart is now endeared to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though he cannot perfectly do it (that's in Heaven), yet he ſeeks to give the <hi>whole will</hi> of Chriſt content, becauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that is unmarried</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>careth for the</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 32.</note> 
               <hi>things that belong to the Lord, how he may pleaſe the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The upright heart, though he cannot joy in the Lords <hi>Love,</hi> yet he will joy in the Lords <hi>Will: His delight is in the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. They cloſe with the whole Will of God as their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>It is not only <hi>good</hi> to do the Lords Will, (for thus men may ſeek the Lord, as thinking it good ſo to do) but as their <hi>Bleſſedneſs;</hi> elſe 'tis not their laſt end, and ſo not <hi>ſought</hi> as their laſt end.</p>
            <p>The ſanctified ſoul obeys God as his Bleſſedneſs; <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of the Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 1. Verſ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep his teſtimonies, and that ſeek him with the whole heart:</hi> This makes them ſeek God with the <hi>whole heart,</hi> becauſe they count this their Bleſſedneſs; this makes a gracious heart prize ſervice to God above the whole Creation, and ſet an higher rate upon a <hi>good work,</hi> than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>miracle;</hi> he had rather be obeying, than working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; rather humbling his ſoul, than removing mountains, becauſe he is doing the <hi>Will</hi> of God.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 8. Saints <hi>reach</hi> after <hi>more</hi> grace: It ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent a Saint to have <hi>grace,</hi> but to have <hi>more</hi> grace: As it

            <p>1. The more <hi>grace</hi> thou haſt, the more of <hi>God</hi> thou haſt in thee: And he that is full of grace, is full of God: <hi>To know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge, that ye might</hi>

               <hi>be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Abundance of grace is <hi>lovely;</hi> for grace is the <hi>beauty</hi> of the ſoul; the <hi>quinteſſence</hi> and ſweetneſs, that doth <hi>dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> and <hi>perfume</hi> the ſoul.</p>
            <p>A little ſugar doth not ſweeten a cup; eſpecially if it be a bitter cup, ſuch as mans <hi>nature</hi> is: we ſay of a <hi>little,</hi> that 'tis as good as none at all.</p>
            <p>A little Frankincenſe doth not perfume a room, eſpecially if it be a ſtinking room, ſuch as mans impure <hi>nature</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Where grace is predominant, there a Saint is <hi>lovely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah my Beloved! God would have the Saints lovely in <hi>his</hi> eye, and lovely in the <hi>Worlds</hi> eye: <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> There muſt be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of light in thee to ſhine over all the <hi>Horizon</hi> of thy Converſation; as there is abundance of light in the Sun that ſhines over all the <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> we live in, and therefore 'tis a great body; ſo muſt thou be a <hi>great Saint</hi> to ſhine before all men; and therefore the <hi>little ſtars</hi> do not ſhine ſcarce to our eye.</p>
            <p>Ah my Beloved! This is the reaſon why many, who call themſelves Saints, are not lovely in the eyes of the World; they have not <hi>abundance</hi> of grace; they have abundance of profeſſion, but not abundance of grace; abundance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but little grace; and this makes them ſo odious in the World; abundance of profeſſion (without grace) makes them but the more odious in the world: The world ſeeth ſo much pride, and ſo little humility in them; ſo much worldlineſs, and ſo little of Heaven in them; ſo much unjuſt dealing, and ſo little truth in them, that the world is apt enough to conclude, that either this is not the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which they <hi>profeſs,</hi> or that they are not <hi>true</hi> to their <hi>profeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> had abundance of grace, and he was very lovely in the eye of the World; he was lovely in <hi>Herods</hi> eye.<note place="margin">Mark 6. 20.</note>

            <p>3. Abundance of grace is lively: for grace is the <hi>life</hi> of the ſoul; and where life is but weak, there the <hi>actings</hi> are not lively: A weak man cannot run; But ſaith <hi>David, I will run the way of thy Commandments:</hi> He was lively, for he had<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 32.</note> abundance of grace.</p>
            <p>

            <p>When the Apoſtles (acted by Faith) came (as Chriſt ſaid) to <hi>cast out Devils;</hi> Did not the Devils <hi>tremble</hi> at them? Saint, <hi>he</hi> fears <hi>thee,</hi> more than thou needeſt fear <hi>him: Jeſus, I know,</hi>

It ought not to ſeem much unto me, to ſerve thee; but this rather ſeems much and marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to me, that thou vouchſafeſt to receive into thy ſervice one ſo poor and unworthy to ſerve thee:</hi> He goeth on, <hi>Behold, all is thine which I have, and whereby I ſerve thee: and yet in very deed, thou rather ſerveſt me, than I thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Nothing but <hi>grace</hi> will bring thee to Heaven: <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>vanities,</hi> and all is <hi>vanity,</hi> but only to <hi>love</hi> God, and wholly to <hi>ſerve</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Knowledg is Vanity: yea Knowledg of <hi>God</hi> himſelf is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and <hi>of Chriſt</hi> himſelf is Vanity, without <hi>grace</hi> to love
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55699:57"/> him, and live to him: As one ſaith, <hi>What will it avail thee</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tho. a Kempis.</note> 
               <hi>to diſpute profoundly of the Trinity, if thou be void of grace, and diſpleaſe the Trinity?</hi> High words ſurely make a man neither <hi>holy,</hi> nor <hi>juſt,</hi> but grace makes him dear to God.</p>
            <p>It is vanity to ſeek after fading riches, it is vanity to gape after withering honours; vanity it is to wiſh to <hi>live long,</hi> and to be careleſs to <hi>live well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now many will ſay, grace doth increaſe in us: we do reach after more grace: and this many falſe hearts ſay they do. My Beloved, <hi>falſe</hi> grace may grow, and doth lengthen out in deſires and dimenſions: many that are Hypocrites glory in this, that their graces <hi>grow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt therefore ſhew you the difference between the <hi>increaſe</hi> of <hi>true</hi> grace, and <hi>counterfeit</hi> grace.</p>
            <p>1. The Hypocrite grows out of Emulation: The true Saint grows out of <hi>love</hi> to goodneſs: The Hypocrite is grieved that <hi>others</hi> go beyond <hi>him,</hi> and over-match him; not love to grace, but a ſpirit of envy makes him to advance: The true Saint grows out of <hi>Duty</hi> to God, to bring in more glory to his Name: The growth of <hi>others</hi> is matter of <hi>his</hi> joy, not of his repining: He is glad that God is <hi>better</hi> ſerved, though it be by another; his only grief is, that <hi>himſelf</hi> can ſerve him no better.</p>
            <p>2. The Hypocrite (another ſort of them) groweth in Parts, but not in the Power of godlineſs; in gifts and curioſities, but not in vital and Divine quicknings: In Knowledg and Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but not in ſtrength againſt ſin and temptations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judas</hi> by converſing with Chriſt, could not but grow in Knowledg; but being not incorporate into Chriſt, never grew in grace.</p>
            <p>But the true Saint grows in his ſpiritual life, in Union to Chriſt, in Communion with God.</p>
            <p>The Hypocrite may grow in quantity, but not in quality; the real Saint grows as much in quality, as in quantity.</p>
            <p>3. The Hypocrite may grow more and more in hearing the word, but the Saint grows in taſting the word; and in taſting that moſt deliciouſly, which is moſt ſpiritual: The Hypocrite longs more after new truths, but the Saint taſtes old Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with new affections, and old truths with a new appetite: The Knowledg of an Hypocrite may grow bigger, but the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55699:58"/> Knowledg of a Saint grows more ſavoury and judicious: The Hypocrite may know more Objects than he did before; but the Saint <hi>reliſhes</hi> the things more ſweetly which he knew before.</p>
            <p>The Hypocrite may grow in enlargements, and pour out lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Prayers; but the Saint prays more ſpiritually.</p>
            <p>The Hypocrites zeal may be a great fire; but the Saints zeal is more <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>diſcreet;</hi> there is more incenſe in his golden cenſer, his <hi>love</hi> more ſolid and active, more to <hi>God,</hi> and leſs to <hi>himſelf</hi> and the world.</p>
            <p>The hypocrite is like a tree, that bears <hi>great</hi> Apples, but they are ſower; but the Saint, the fruit he bears it may be are not ſuch <hi>big</hi> Apples, but they are <hi>ſweet</hi> Apples, the <hi>juice</hi> is better, that gives them a more pleaſant reliſh in Gods palate.</p>
            <p>There is a ſweeter juice of love and kindneſs, and godly ſorrow, and filial delight in God, in a Saints duties; and here the Saints growth chiefly lyes, his fruit groweth more ripe and mellow, and ſo more pleaſant and ſweet: His Prayers are not bigger in quantity, but better in quality; he grows in choiceneſs of ſpirit; he comes to the Throne of grace with a more precious eſteem of Chriſt upon his heart: He comes to the word with a dearer thirſt upon his palate; 'tis the ſame Chriſt that is ſet ſtill before him, but he <hi>reliſheth</hi> Chriſt more ſweetly, receiveth and taſteth the ſame promiſes more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhingly, trembleth at the ſame threatnings more tenderly and meltingly: Whereas the hypocrite is cloyed with the word, if it be not diſh'd up to his palate; but the Saints pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late is ſpiritualized to the word.</p>
            <p>The hypocrites taſt of Sermons, is flatted by reading of Books; but the Saints taſte is quickned by the ſenſe of his wants.</p>
            <p>For this is the true uſe of reading, and the end of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, To make <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> more ſenſible of our wants, and make <hi>Chriſt</hi> more excellent in our eyes.</p>
            <p>Therefore in taking notes, the hypocrite picks out matter here and there according to his nice and licquoriſh palate; but the hungry Saint takes all, and feeds upon all that comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, feeling his need to be ſtirred up to <hi>conſider</hi> what he knows.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:55699:58"/>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 9. Here's a ſweet ground to aſſure the Saints <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance:</hi> To him that hath grace, he ſhall not loſe it, but more ſhall be given him; he ſhall not loſe what he hath, but he ſhall have more than he hath; he ſhall not fall away, but ſtand faſter.</p>
            <p>They that fall away, are thoſe that have not truth of grace at all; <hi>Whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away, even that he hath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the poor Saint, that hath, <hi>To him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſhall be ſo far from <hi>loſing</hi> grace, that he ſhall have <hi>more</hi> grace.</p>
            <p>Dub. <hi>But my grace is but little, I cannot ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> God ſhall make thee ſtand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. Where diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of <hi>him that is weak in the faith,</hi> (Verſ. 1.) ſaith he, (Verſ. 4.) <hi>HE ſhall be holden up, for God is able to make him ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more weak thou art, the more tender God will be over thee; if thou canſt not ſtand, he will make thee ſtand, thou ſhalt ſtand in <hi>his arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Chriſt, you have not only the <hi>graces</hi> of Chriſt, but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I pray you mark it.</p>
            <p>1. If <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood (how long, we know not; it may be, had he ſtood the firſt ſhock of Satans temptation), all his Poſterity ſhould have had that aſſiſtance of the Spirit, that they ſhould have never fallen; as the Holy Angels, that were contented with their <hi>firſt ſtation, and abode in the truth</hi> (when the other Angels fell), this was their <hi>Obedience,</hi> that they were loyal in the day of their great Tryal, when the others their Fellow angels rebelled, and their <hi>reward</hi> was, That they are confirmed in their happy condition, and ſecured in it; ſo if <hi>Adam</hi> hemſelf (in whom we were all one man) had ſtood, I ſay, if he therefore had ſtood it out to the laſt, both he and all his Poſterity ſhould have had the continual and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant aſſiſtance of the Spirit, and been confirmed, ſo as never to have fallen.</p>
            <p>And the ground is, the rule of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> for if he falling, all his Poſterity are forſaken of God, and put under the Reign of Sin, and Death, and Satan; then, he ſtanding, all his Poſterity
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55699:59"/> ſhould have had the perpetual Preſence of Gods Spirit, and been under the everlaſting Reign of the Spirit of grace and life.</p>
            <p>2. But now Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> (who was the Head of the <hi>new</hi> ſeed and family) he ſtood; and therefore propagates to all his Poſterity the <hi>perennious Preſence,</hi> and <hi>conſtant aſſiſtance</hi> of the Spirit, whereby (being once begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him), they live for ever, and abide in him.</p>
            <p>As in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, we all fell, ſo in Chriſts ſtanding, we all ſtand; the Lord Jeſus having ſtood, they cannot fall; becauſe by virtue of his ſtanding, they have the eternal Preſence of the Holy Ghoſt: I ſay the ground is Chriſts ſtanding; for though there are many reaſons, why the Saints ſhall not fall from Chriſt, as the immutable love of God, the Covenant of Grace, the ſpirit of Grace, and the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt: yet <hi>all theſe</hi> are bottomed upon Chriſts ſtanding and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Covenant: For therefore is the Covenant of grace <hi>unchangeable,</hi> and the <hi>federal</hi> love of God to us in that Covenant <hi>immutable,</hi> and the dwelling of the ſpirit <hi>eternal,</hi> and the ſealing of the ſpirit <hi>indelible,</hi> becauſe built upon the unchangeable Prieſthood of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch a <hi>Prieſt</hi> as ſtood and finiſhed the work, ſo ſtood as to ſatisfie Juſtice, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh Satan: And the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven for us is built upon the ſtanding and perſeverance of Jeſus Chriſt; had not Chriſt ſtood, his Interceſſion had not now been ſtanding; had he fell, <hi>that</hi> had fell to the ground alſo: had he fell, the Holy Ghoſt had not been given.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the Covenant of grace reigns to life<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 21.</note> eternal.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that they who receive Chriſt, ſhall be ſure to<note place="margin">Verſ. 27.</note> reign with him.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that our Juſtification by Chriſt is not a <hi>tottering</hi> or <hi>fallible</hi> Juſtification, that may be loſt, but a Juſtification<note place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> 
               <hi>unto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word; hence it is, that the Spirit when he comes, he comes to <hi>dwell</hi> and <hi>abide</hi> in Believers.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He is called the <hi>ſpirit that abides for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I am returned where I began; Saints, your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance is <hi>certain</hi> in it ſelf (though not perhaps to you), becauſe in Jeſus Chriſt you have not only the <hi>graces</hi> of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55699:59"/> Chriſt, but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Chriſt: the ſpirit <hi>dwelling</hi> and <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> in you.</p>
            <p>1. The ſpirit knits the ſoul to the Lord, and never ſuffers that <hi>Love-knot</hi> to be untied again: This knot the ſpirit makes, is ſtronger than the <hi>Gordian-knot,</hi> which cannot only not be looſed, but <hi>cannot</hi> be cut aſunder.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gordian-knot, Alexander the Great,</hi> when he could not looſe it, cut it aſunder; but this knot whereby the Saints are tyed to Chriſt, 'tis ſuch a knot as can neither be untied, nor cut aſunder.</p>
            <p>2. When the poor ſoul is careleſs of himſelf, the ſpirit keeps him; he ſleeps, and the ſpirit ſits by him: The <hi>wiſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> took a nap as well as the <hi>fooliſh;</hi> they fell into a ſleep of carnal ſecurity, but the ſpirit watcht by them, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them.</p>
            <p>3. When the poor ſoul is weak, the ſpirit helps him.</p>
            <p>4. When the froward ſoul offers to run from the Lord, the Spirit follows him: <hi>Jonah</hi> run from God, but the Spirit fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him into the Sea, and into the Whales belly, and there he prayeth, and looks again toward the holy Temple: Is not this your wonder?</p>
            <p>5. When the unkind ſoul <hi>grieves</hi> the ſpirit, yet the ſpirit ſtill keeps the houſe, and will not depart from him, and ſo not ſuffer the ſoul wholly to depart from the Lord: When <hi>David</hi> ſinned and defiled himſelf, he <hi>grieved</hi> the ſpirit, he <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted</hi> the houſe, and yet the ſpirit would not <hi>leave</hi> the houſe; the ſpirit ſtai'd to keep grace alive in the embers, and to blow it again into a new flame at <hi>Nathans</hi> Sermon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 10. You, to whom God hath given grace; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of grace; here's a great deal of work for you to do.</p>
            <p>1. Give the Lord the Honour of his grace: And now (the Lord knows) I know not to whom I ſpeak: <hi>The Lord knows who are his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some that make the leaſt appearance, may have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt grace; and ſome that caſt the greateſt luſtre, may have no grace; a ſlight Impreſſion upon the ſoul, among men, goeth for grace: But you that have ſearched your hearts, and found the pearl there, give the Lord the Honour of his grace,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55699:60"/> that ever he ſhould plant ſuch a flower in your boſoms.</p>
            <p>For the laſt end of all the <hi>Elect</hi> is to admire and honour the <hi>riches</hi> of Gods grace.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5, 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beloved,</hi> This is Heavens work, Oh! learn this ſong before you go thither, which none learn but the <hi>redeemed</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 3.</note> of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Lord in all his dealings with his people, ſeeks laſtly to bring about the glory of his grace.</p>
            <p>1. He leaves them a long time in their graves of ſin, before he gives them the reſurrection of grace: that they live like other men, wallow in ſin as other men; which is ſtrange, that he that loved them ſo long, ſhould leave them ſo long to be as bad as any; yet this he doth, becauſe it makes for the praiſe of his grace, <hi>Eph. 2. 2, 4, 7, 8 verſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this doth ſo confound Gods People, that they wiſh not only <hi>Heaven,</hi> but <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Ages to come,</hi> may record this love.</p>
            <p>2. Out of men fallen he picks out uſually the pooreſt and the vileſt: The <hi>younger Brother,</hi> moſt deſpiſed, and leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in a Family, and leaves the elder: <hi>Jacob have I loved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11, 13. 1. Cor. 1. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Eſau have I hated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſtrange that the Lord ſhould chuſe thus; but this he doth to blur the Glory of all the World.</p>
            <p>3. The Lord leaves many wants in his People, under which they ſit ſighing, and ſometime very long: Sometimes he takes away thoſe feelings, thoſe enlargements they had, hides his face from them; that if ever he returns in love, his grace may be the ſweeter, and laſt the longer,</p>
            <p>4. Sometimes he refuſeth to hear their Prayers, that when he doth anſwer them; at laſt his free-grace may be adored and cryed up.</p>
            <p>5. Sometimes he humbleth them with vexing ſins, and pricking diſtempers, and it is to advance grace.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7, 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>6. In a word, you ſhall find the Lord ſo ſtrangely carrying on matters (as if he did not love, nor care for his people) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>hair</hi> and <hi>grain</hi> of their deſires; and when all comes to winding up, 'tis <hi>to advance grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All a mans good days, and bad days; all Gods frowns and ſmiles; all the Lords food and phyſick; all God cares for, works, and plots for, 'tis to do his people no more hurt than
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55699:60"/> this, To advance his grace <hi>in</hi> them, and <hi>by</hi> them.</p>
            <p>All his hewings and hammerings of you, his knocking you a pieces, and new melting, and new caſting of you 'tis that you may be veſſels of his glorious grace, that you may be able to live in the Air of Gods grace, to ſuck in, and breathe out grace; and let all the powers of Hell ſeek to blur it, yet grace ſhall conquer: Who would not be under grace! Oh poor creature! Satan is tempting, ſin vexing, yet <hi>grace muſt reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Act for Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Do</hi> the work of Chriſt, and <hi>finiſh</hi> it: Chriſt gives <hi>grace,</hi> becauſe he hath given <hi>work</hi> for grace to do: Chriſt ſets up a work <hi>in</hi> you, that he may do work <hi>by</hi> you for himſelf: every <hi>Principle</hi> is for <hi>Operation:</hi> The eye for ſeeing, and the ear for hearing: ſo grace is for work.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſay, Chriſt hath <hi>begun</hi> a good work in you; be you then at his work daily, and finiſh it.</p>
            <p>As it was with Chriſt the Head, ſo ſhould it be with all his members; <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me</hi>

               <hi>to do.</hi>

            <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaking to the Saints that had grace begun in them, ſaith he, <hi>As you have yielded your members ſervants</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 19.</note> 
               <hi>to uncleanneſs, and to iniquity—Even ſo now yield your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſervants to righteouſneſs, unto holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Sirs, before you had grace, you ſerved <hi>ſin;</hi> and having grace, will you not ſtir up your ſelves to ſerve <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Your ſo long ſervice to <hi>ſin,</hi> ſhould ſet a keen edg upon you to ſerve <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You live in Times and Places wherein men have ſo much work of their own to do, that Chriſt is neglected; and few men <hi>walk</hi> with God, or <hi>act</hi> for God.</p>
            <p>Some take mens Examples for patterns and copies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves to do as <hi>others</hi> do.</p>
            <p>Others are apt to put off Chriſt with <hi>deſires,</hi> but ſerve Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>indeed:</hi> Others are catching at comforts and promiſes, but neglect Precepts; the Commands of God are tedious and burthenſom to them: Surely then, you in whom the work of grace is begun, it ſtands you upon to be at work for God:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55699:61"/> whilſt others ſhut up ſhop, and are <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> you ſhould drive on a Trade for him.</p>
            <p>1. For he hath ſet you up again: he hath underlaid and ſtockt you with Principles of Action; he hath put you into a way of doing, and given you wheels to move upon; he hath made you Wings to fly.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Many excuſe their negligence by pretending</hi> inability: <hi>How often do Saints put a fine dreſs upon their lazineſs! Alas I am nothing of my ſelf: except God give me an heart and ſtrength, what can I do?</hi> Without me (<hi>ſaith Chriſt</hi>) ye can<note place="margin">John 15. 5.</note> do nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Do not deceive your ſelves, God will not be mocked.</p>
            <p>1. The words of Chriſt have this meaning, <hi>without me,</hi> that is, <hi>ſeparate</hi> from me, <hi>ye can do nothing;</hi> that is, till you are planted in me: Now you ſay, you are planted in Chriſt, and therefore your excuſe is but a lye: This expreſſion of Chriſt ſpeaks no more but this, that till you be knit to Chriſt, you are but dead and barren Branches, as Chriſt explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>As the branch cannot bring forth fruit of it ſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note> 
               <hi>me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now you ſay, you are knit and united to Chriſt; and therefore away with theſe couzening vizors and palliations: If you are not yet in Chriſt, then confeſs it; if you ſay you are in Chriſt, then ſay not, you can do nothing.</p>
            <p>2. The regenerate have a power to Act for God, and to do work for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Elſe there is no <hi>ſpecifical difference</hi> between a man regenerate, and unregenerate, if both were without ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhould not have as much benefit by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> as we had by the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> The firſt would have communicated his Power to do good, and being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, doth communicate Power to do evil: Therefore much more by <hi>Chriſt</hi> have we a Power to act for God in our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If you are in Chriſt, you are living Branches,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55699:61"/> vital Members, and all life is a Power to act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What is grace but a <hi>repairing</hi> of that Holineſs and Image of God, which we loſt in <hi>Adam?</hi> But that was a Power to do what God required, therefore ſo far as that Image is renewed, ſo far there is a Power.</p>
            <p>And therefore Saints, <hi>Act for Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> I ſay, you have wings, and therefore fly upon action, ſoar up a loſt in Service for Jeſus Chriſt: God hath given you feet, and therefore <hi>run the way of his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath ſaid to you, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to the man that was<note place="margin">Act 3.</note> lame from his mothers Womb, <hi>In the name of Jeſus Chriſt riſe up and walk, and your feet and ancle-bones received ſtrength:</hi> And therefore God expects that you ſhould be upon employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, It is true, we have <hi>habitual</hi> grace, a new frame of heart; but we muſt have <hi>aſſiſting</hi> grace and influence, elſe we can do nothing; the work is hard, and we cannot act without new breathings.</p>
            <p>I ſay, Let the duty be to nature impoſſible, yet the Lord is at hand to help, even when there is no ſtrength: <hi>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might, he</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 29.</note> 
               <hi>increaſeth ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know how the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> pleaded impoſſibilities, and then the Lords anger roſe when they were ready to enter <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you had no <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no <hi>Spirit,</hi> no <hi>Promiſe</hi> to aſſure you to help, you might then let fall Duties, and ceaſe to action, and ſay 'tis impoſſible I ſhould ever overcome ſuch ſins, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a meaſure of grace; or bear the Croſs, or do any thing</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Promiſes</hi> to aſſure you, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> to breathe upon you, are at hand; now to plead <hi>impoſſibility,</hi> is to <hi>reproach</hi> the Lord: If you were under the <hi>Law,</hi> you might plead this; but under <hi>Grace</hi> 'tis horrible to make this excuſe: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber therefore <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> who went out in the Name and Spirit of the Lord, and they were helped.</p>
            <p>3. Know this, that the more difficult any work or duty is, the more ſweetneſs ſhall you find in it, if you break through it: <hi>He that overcomes, ſhall eat of the hidden Manna:</hi> Have you not found your ſelves dead to Prayer? yet you fell to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55699:62"/> it, and then would not but have took the ſeaſon for a world: <hi>The husbandman that hath laboured, eats afterward of his</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 6.</note> 
               <hi>fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You plead the difficulty of a Chriſtian life, and therefore taſte not the ſweetneſs of it: If you can do no more than what is <hi>eaſie,</hi> and pleaſeth <hi>ſelf,</hi> the Lord will never let you taſte the ſweetneſs of pleaſing <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. What do you mean to be? Like whom? <hi>Chriſt</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you to breathe out this Prayer, <hi>Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven:</hi> Do you <hi>look</hi> for Heaven, and will you not <hi>act</hi> as they do in Heaven? whom do you make your pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns? If you are not <hi>like</hi> Heaven, you are Baſtards, not Sons: I am ſure <hi>Angels</hi> are content to come out of Heaven to do the work of God; nay the <hi>Lord Chriſt himſelf</hi> came down from Heaven, and was made <hi>lower than the Angels</hi> to do the Work of God; and ſhall your hands ſhrink at it? or will you think your ſelves <hi>too good</hi> to do it? You have here the nobleſt patterns, and moſt unparallel'd Copies to write after: Like whom then do you mean to be? Will you draw back from <hi>Angels</hi> work? from the work the <hi>Son of God</hi> was at? If you mean to ſhine as Angels, do the Work of God with Angels; if you would be where Chriſt is, be at the work that Chriſt was.</p>
            <p>And let me tell you, your time is but ſhort, and you have done but <hi>little</hi> work, <hi>none</hi> at all to purpoſe; and 'tis not long till your Crown ſhall be put upon your head; and will you not be aſhamed then to wear ſo rich a <hi>Crown</hi> for ſo poor a <hi>Service?</hi> To have God pay you ſo great wages for ſo little work done. Certainly, if ever it come to your ſhare to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> you will (when the Crown is putting upon your head) bluſh for ſhame to think of your <hi>cowardiſe,</hi> and your <hi>lazineſs,</hi> that you ſhould wear a <hi>Crown,</hi> that have done ſo <hi>little work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Lord will do thy work: do thou but <hi>his</hi> work, and he will do <hi>thine:</hi> The Lord will take the care and charge of thee, to bring about thy ends for thee: many of you are ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Chriſts work, becauſe of ſo many diſtractions of your own; others of you wave Chriſts work out of <hi>love</hi> to your own, I mean the World; What will become of my Family, Wife and Children? Oh unbelieving wretches! ſet your hearts
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55699:62"/> to do <hi>Gods</hi> Work, and he'l take the care of your Families and Children upon himſelf: ſet thy face to the Sun, and theſe ſhadows will follow you: <hi>The Lord is a ſun and a ſhield, the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 84. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Lord will give grace and glory,</hi> [the Lord will give grace, i. e. <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>eſteem</hi> among men, the <hi>favour</hi> of men, and <hi>glory</hi> too in the World], <hi>No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly:</hi> Set thy face then toward this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sun, ſerve him, and theſe ſhadows will follow thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon,</hi> you know, askt for <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> that he might diſcern between good and bad, and judg the people; and God tells him, becauſe thou haſt asked this thing, <hi>and haſt not asked riohes and honours,</hi> therefore <hi>I will give thee riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon,</hi> his great care and work was to rule a <hi>State</hi> well, and the Lord gave him all the reſt; he ſet his face to the Sun, and the ſhadows followed him: Oh then, Sirs, <hi>Act</hi> for God, up and be doing, do <hi>his</hi> work, and he'l do <hi>yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are theſe three Things attend the man that gives himſelf to do work for God.</p>
            <p>1. There ſhall not any evil <hi>hurt</hi> thee: The <hi>three children</hi> were in the fire, and yet the fire <hi>did not, could not</hi> hurt them: <hi>In the fire, and in the water</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will be with thee, there ſhall not any evil hurt thee:</hi> Whereas, if thou doſt not, <hi>thy good things ſhall,</hi> they ſhall hurt thee: Thy riches, and thine honours, they ſhall lift thee up, and there make thy head <hi>giddy</hi> upon the top of thy glory, and then thou comeſt tumbling down, like a drunken fool, into <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>hell</hi> it ſelf: <hi>Tolluntur in altum, ut lapſa graviore ruant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. All creatures in Heaven and Earth ſhall ſerve the <hi>man</hi> that ſerves his God: The <hi>Whale</hi> ſhall ſerve <hi>Jonah</hi> to carry him to the ſhore; Indeed the poor man at that time ran from Gods work, yet becauſe he was his <hi>Servant,</hi> the fiſh ſhall ſwallow him, that it might ſave him: The Ravens ſhall feed <hi>Elijah: I will hear the heavens,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and they ſhall</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 21. 22:</note> 
               <hi>hear the earth: and the earth ſhall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oyl, and they ſhall hear Jezreel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus all creatures in Heaven and Earth ſhall ſerve that man that ſerves his God: Whereas elſe, they all groan under thee,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55699:63"/> and above thee: The <hi>Heavens</hi> above groan over the ſinner, and cry out, How long, Lord, how long ſhall we beſtow our influence upon this Enemy of thine? The <hi>Earth</hi> groans under the <hi>unprofitable ſervant,</hi> and crys out, How long, Lord, how long ſhall I bear this uſeleſs burden? Nay <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> is weary of this <hi>fruitleſs Tree;</hi> how long ſhall we ſtand? <hi>Cut it down, why cumbers it the ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thou that art at thy Lords work, the <hi>Angels</hi> ſhall come out of Heaven to <hi>guard</hi> thee: thou art a greater man than the greateſt General under the Sun: thou haſt the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> to be thy <hi>Life-guard: Are they not all ministring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>ſent forth to minister for them, who ſhall be heirs of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore let's ſee who <hi>dare</hi> touch thee? <hi>Take heed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 10.</note> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that ye deſpiſe [or hurt] not one of theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones: For I ſay unto you, that in heaven their angels do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw a ladder reaching from Earth to Heaven, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels deſcending and aſcending.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 10. The laſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> ſhall ſhew you, <hi>how</hi> God makes Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to his Saints graces: And herein his Methods are <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> if not <hi>unſearchable:</hi> yet by fathoming we may <hi>ſound</hi> ſome of them, though not the bottom.</p>
            <p>As <hi>grace</hi> it ſelf is a Myſtery, ſo the <hi>increaſe</hi> of grace, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being carried on by ſuch Myſteries.</p>
            <p>And therefore the <hi>contrivement</hi> whereby God increaſeth grace is excellent, worth the knowing; that we may know what he is doing with us in his Providences, and may read the Mind of God in many of his proceedings; In a word, how ſhall we <hi>help on</hi> the work, if we know not Gods Method in working?</p>
            <p>1. The Lord increaſeth grace in his People by their <hi>Faith:</hi> Faith is <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Graces,</hi> and therefore needs ſupport her ſelf; but ſhe is the <hi>mouth</hi> of all the reſt, that <hi>ſpeaks</hi> for them to God in Prayer, and <hi>ſucks</hi> nutriment for them out of the Breaſts of the <hi>Promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sirs, The caſe is this; <hi>Faith</hi> lives upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all the <hi>Graces</hi> live upon <hi>Faith:</hi> When there is a famine in the Land of the ſoul, Faith goeth up to our Brother <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55699:63"/> brngs home Corn: Faith is the <hi>Mother-grace,</hi> and as the <hi>old bird,</hi> the <hi>Dam</hi> flyeth abroad, and fetcheth in food to her young ones, and diſtributes it to them all in the neſt: So <hi>Faith</hi> takes Wing (when the <hi>graces</hi> ſit <hi>hungry,</hi> and in <hi>want</hi> at home) I ſay, then Faith takes Wing and flyeth to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the promiſe; ſhe comes home with her mouth full, and ſerves all the <hi>graces,</hi> they are <hi>fed</hi> by her; And therefore the Scripture ſaith, That <hi>the juſt lives by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which expreſſion the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of in two of his Epiſtles. Firſt in <hi>Rom. 1. 17, The juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> that is in reſpect of <hi>forgiveneſs of ſin,</hi> and in reſpect of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> or <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38, where he uſeth this ſame phraſe, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Saints <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> and ſtanding faſt in all their troubles and temptations.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>prime</hi> grace, that helps and ſuccours all the reſt: <hi>Hope</hi> lives upon Faith; for the hope of a Chriſtian is but poor in fruition; we can <hi>hope</hi> no longer than we <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</hi> He that hopes and expects the things promiſed, muſt by Faith live upon the <hi>certainty</hi> of the promiſe, and the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the promiſer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Love</hi> lives upon Faith: we can <hi>love</hi> God no longer than we <hi>believe:</hi> When the <hi>imaginary</hi> Faith of wicked men (like a candle) dyeth within them, their <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> love to God goeth out with it alſo: They hate him in Hell, and can do no other: we <hi>love God</hi> no longer than we have a <hi>good opinion</hi> of his love to us; 'tis <hi>Faith</hi> that ſeeds this Lamp with Oyl: <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us:</hi> And therefore when the ſpring of <hi>Faith</hi> is low, the ſtream of <hi>Love</hi> is very ebb.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer</hi> lives upon Faith; we <hi>pray</hi> no longer than we <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> Prayer ſhall be heard: We knock <hi>no longer</hi> at Gods door, than Faith ſeeth we are <hi>welcom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When a man feels guilt of ſin, yet <hi>Faith</hi> ſeeth the Lord will pardon it for his own <hi>name-ſake: Who is a God like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mica 7. 18.</note> 
               <hi>thee, that pardons iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſions of the remnant of his heritage?—He will turn again, he will have compaſſion on us, he will ſubdue</hi> [i. e. pardon] <hi>our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi> [ſo the word ſignifies], <hi>and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When a man feels the ſtrength of ſin, yet Faith ſeeth that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55699:64"/> the Lord will <hi>waſte</hi> and <hi>ſubdue</hi> it; and doth not this bear up grace from ſinking? With what courage doth grace fight againſt ſin, when <hi>Faith</hi> tells her, God is on your ſide, and you <hi>ſhall overcome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> finds and feels reſt in trouble; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the upright there</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 112. 4.</note> 
               <hi>ariſeth light in the darkneſs:</hi> The life of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is a life of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is a life contrary to <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon:</hi> when the Lord <hi>kills,</hi> what, Doth he intend then to <hi>ſave</hi> me? yes that he doth; ſaith <hi>Faith;</hi> and therefore, <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him;</hi> and thus is grace inlivened.</p>
            <p>When the Lord <hi>binds</hi> me in Cords of miſery, doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend me any <hi>good?</hi> Yes, ſaith <hi>Faith,</hi> he intends to <hi>teach</hi> thee, and <hi>instruct</hi> thee; <hi>Bleſſed is he whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 12. Verſ. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and teachest him out of thy law: that thou mayeſt give him reſt from the days of adverſity: WHILE the pit is digged for the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith informs the Soul, that God is upon a <hi>good work,</hi> whilſt he is binding and breaking his people: Oh! he is teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſome high and holy leſſon, his corrections are their inſtructions: He is <hi>preparing</hi> them for a day of proſperity; As 'tis in the next verſe, <hi>That thou mayst give him rest from the days of adverſity, while the pit is digged for the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where take notice of theſe two Things:</p>
            <p>1. While God is <hi>chaſtiſing</hi> his People, he is <hi>preparing</hi> them for a day of <hi>ſmiles</hi> and <hi>felicities:</hi> When he was breaking <hi>Job</hi> upon the wheel of Affliction, he was but preparing him for a greater day of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Proſperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. While God by chaſtiſements is preparing <hi>his people</hi> for ſome greater happineſs, at that very time he is preparing a Gallows for the <hi>wicked,</hi> he is digging their pit to <hi>bury</hi> them in [<hi>That thou mayſt give him reſt from the day of adverſity: while the pit is digged for the wicked</hi>].</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Jews</hi> were under a Cloud, and God preparing <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance</hi> for them, he was at that very time preparing <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Gallows:</hi> The wicked (like condemned men) are ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live, till their Gallows and Grave be made ready.</p>
            <p>Now Faith is <hi>well read</hi> in Divine Myſteries, in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; ſhe acquaints the ſoul, that God by chaſtiſing and touching the Body, is teaching her, that his ſtrokes are not huntful; <hi>Nocumenta ſunt Documenta.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:55699:64"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Lord increaſeth grace in his People, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a <hi>tenderneſs</hi> upon their Conſciences; 'tis grace that makes the Conſcience tender, and that tenderneſs nurſeth up grace with exquiſite care in the ſoul: The moſt tender hearted nurſe is not more chary of her dear Babe, to give it ſuck, keep it clean, preſerve it from harms, and ſee it come on and proſper, than the tender Conſcience is of her grace, the ſweet Babe of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> within her: Bleſſed, yea <hi>thrice bleſſed</hi> are they, to whom God hath given a <hi>tender conſcience:</hi> As grace <hi>withers</hi> and <hi>ſhrinks</hi> up by an hardneſs coming upon the heart; ſo grace <hi>improves</hi> mightily in a ſoft and tender ſoyl.</p>
            <p>1. The tender Conſcience ſtartles at <hi>ſecret</hi> ſins, as well as open ſins; to ſin in the dark as well as in the light; his <hi>Memento</hi> (or if you pleaſe his <hi>Motto</hi>) is, <hi>Shall not God ſearch this out?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 21.</note> He fears Gods Eye more than all the Worlds eye.</p>
            <p>The tender Conſcience trembleth at your <hi>cunning arts</hi> and ways of ſinning, whereby in your <hi>bargains</hi> you can bring about your covetous deſires under hand, and no man diſcern you.</p>
            <p>You call only thoſe ſins <hi>ſecret,</hi> that are done in a <hi>corner;</hi> but if in your <hi>publick</hi> dealings, you can by your ſubtilties come over another; Are not <hi>theſe</hi> ſecret ſins too? Tender conſcience cannot ſwallow them: And is not grace <hi>growing</hi> now?</p>
            <p>2. Tender conſcience is quick and <hi>ſenſitive</hi> of ſmall ſins, vain thoughts, idle words, leſſer oaths, wanton glances, wiſhes and motions to ſin: He knows no <hi>duty</hi> ſmall, becauſe there's no <hi>Commandment</hi> ſmall; he calls no <hi>ſin</hi> little, becauſe there's no <hi>poyſon</hi> little, no <hi>death</hi> little, no <hi>hell</hi> little; and doth not this give ſtrength to grace?</p>
            <p>3. The tender conſcience ſmites the Saint after he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as oft as he ſinneth: After ſin committed, his heart gives him no reſt, till he hath made his peace with God: If <hi>corrupt nature</hi> cannot but ſin, yet <hi>renewed conſcience</hi> cannot but repent of ſin; it cannot but riſe again, if <hi>God</hi> be offended; it <hi>cannot but</hi> meet him with humiliation: if <hi>Man</hi> be wronged, it <hi>cannot but</hi> make reſtitution, or ſatisfaction, as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did: When <hi>David</hi> had ſinned in <hi>numbring the people,</hi> his <hi>heart ſmote him, I have ſinned greatly in that I have done.</hi> Surely 2<note place="margin">Sam. 24. 10.</note> grace gets ground by this.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:55699:65"/>
            <p>4. Tender conſcience trembles at the <hi>appearance</hi> of evil, as ſome eyes cannot abide to look on the Picture or Image of a <hi>Toad;</hi> that which looks <hi>like</hi> ſin, he abhors it: it <hi>ſcares</hi> a holy ſoul from any <hi>enterprize,</hi> if it be but <hi>male coloratum,</hi> an ill aſpect.</p>
            <p>Every thing that might any way redound to the wounding of Religion, or at which any offence might be taken, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains it not; and doth not this give nutriment to grace?</p>
            <p>5. Tender conſcience is jealous of the appearance of <hi>good:</hi> as it hates the appearance of evil, ſo it dares not <hi>always truſt</hi> every appearance of good: The tender conſcience (as far as it hath light) <hi>will try all things, and hold faſt only what is good,</hi> not what <hi>ſeems</hi> ſo: <hi>Satan</hi> deceives more eaſily, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys more dangerouſly, when he aſſumes the ſhape of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light: That which is highly eſteemed among men, is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 15.</note> 
               <hi>in the ſight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Tender conſcience takes heed of what he knows lawful: He doth not only <hi>fly</hi> what appears evil, and <hi>try</hi> what appears good, but is <hi>coy</hi> of what he knows <hi>lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will ſay, this is <hi>pure niceneſs, nee lleſs preciſeneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I tell you, you know not the Scriptures: <hi>All things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but all things are not expedient: All things are lawful for</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 12. 1 Cor. 10. 23.</note> 
               <hi>me, but all things edifie not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The judicious, tender conſcience, asks <hi>Bernards</hi> three Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>An Liceat? An Deceat? An Expediat?</hi> Is it <hi>lawful?</hi> May I do it and not ſin? But ſuppoſe it be lawful, Is it <hi>comely?</hi> Is it becoming me a Chriſtian? May I do it, and not reflect upon my Profeſſion? Is it <hi>expedient?</hi> May I do it, and not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my <hi>weak Brother?</hi> There are ſome things we muſt deny our ſelves <hi>for others ſakes:</hi> Things that are <hi>evil,</hi> we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them for <hi>our own ſakes;</hi> and many <hi>lawful</hi> things we muſt deny for <hi>others ſakes: If meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8 13.</note> 
               <hi>fleſh while the world ſtands, leſt I make my brother to offend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. The tender conſcience obſerves as well what he hoth not, as what he doth; regards omiſſions, as well as commiſſions. Our Lord Chriſt was as much diſpleaſed with <hi>Peters</hi> diſſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him from ſuffering, as with <hi>Satans</hi> perſwaſion to fall down and worſhip him; his anſwer was the ſame to both, <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou muſt as well obſerve what thou doeſt not, as what
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55699:65"/> thou doeſt: The tender conſcience takes notice of every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he hath to do good, trembleth to <hi>neglect duty,</hi> as much as to <hi>act ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God advanceth grace in his People, by preſerving their <hi>appetite</hi> to Ordinances: They that are not hungry, cannot feed: It is <hi>uncomfortable</hi> to come with a full ſtomack to a full Table: They <hi>look</hi> upon the diſhes, while others <hi>eat</hi> of them: Theſe may <hi>talk</hi> of Chriſt and Religion, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers feed on them: A mans graces cannot grow ſtrong, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he feed; and he cannot feed, unleſs he is hungry: And therefore God adds ſtrength to his Saints graces, by preſerving appetite in them to his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> was hungry, <hi>he heard a voice, ſaying, Riſe and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>eat.</hi> It is Gods delight to fill <hi>the hungry with good things:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 53. Matth. 5. 6.</note> And this it is, that Chriſt ſtiles them <hi>Bleſſed: Bleſſed are they which hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hunger, though it ſpeaks want, yet there's a bleſſedneſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, <hi>They ſhall be filled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a ſtrange promiſe, that a man ſhould be filled for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, but becauſe he is hungry: Among men it is not ſo: In the Goſpel the poor mans <hi>hunger</hi> is his <hi>Bleſſing:</hi> In the World the poor mans hunger is his miſery, becauſe men are not willing to feed him as oft as he is hungry; and therefore the poor man of the world could wiſh he might be never a hungry: But in the Goſpel (through Gods free-grace and bounty), <hi>Bleſſed are the hungry, for they ſhall be filled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their appetite makes them eat Chriſt, and eat promiſes, and eat pardon of ſin, and eating makes them ſtrong.</p>
            <p>Their hunger makes them prize Ordinances, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel proviſions; when they are called, they come to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; they do not make excuſes, but come to the ſupper; and theſe gueſts God himſelf bids them welcom, and carves unto them; and therefore their graces muſt needs thrive.</p>
            <p>God accepts our <hi>appetite</hi> as much as if we paid ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for his graces; <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 1.</note> 
               <hi>waters, buy and eat:</hi> Their <hi>hunger</hi> is inſtead of a <hi>price,</hi> their <hi>thirſt</hi> pleaſeth him as much as <hi>payment;</hi> and therefore, <hi>Bleſſed are the hungry, for they ſhall be filled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What made <hi>Davids</hi> graces thrive ſo well, but his <hi>appetite</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:55699:66"/> to the Ordinances? <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord—that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord, and to enquire in his</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 4.</note> 
               <hi>temple:—O God, thou art my God,—My ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee—To ſee thy power and thy</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in thy ſanctuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> had a keen-appetite after the Ordinances, and his appetite made his graces ſtrong: I ſay, his appetite made him <hi>reliſh</hi> the word; <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 103.</note> 
               <hi>yea, ſweeter than honey to my mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this made him feed ſo heartily when he came; <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And now grace muſt needs grow, becauſe their palate is qualified for ſuch delicates; they taſte them with a tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delight, and feed upon them with extream pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Thus God animates and ſtrengthens his Saints graces by preſerving a freſh appetite in them to Ordinances.</p>
            <p>And how doth he preſerve their appetite to Ordinances? Becauſe this is ſo neceſſary to keep grace alive and vigorous in the ſoul, therefore you ſhall find God runs various Methods to accompliſh it.</p>
            <p>1. He keeps their <hi>ſins</hi> in their eye, or ſome ſpecial ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Conſcience: <hi>My ſin</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) is ever before</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 3.</note> 
               <hi>me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quietneſs within, no trouble upon the Conſcience, will in time dull the appetite: Men ſurfeit upon their peace within: As a long peace <hi>corrupts</hi> a State, and breeds <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>vices</hi> in it; a ſtill and ſtanding pool is full of mud, ſo a continued peace in the ſoul begets much vanity, and many diſeaſes in her.</p>
            <p>Quietneſs takes away her ſtomach: And therefore God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents ſome ſin that we have done to the ſoul, and ſtings the conſcience with it; and then the ſoul runs, and looks up to the brazen Serpent: God will not ſuffer your conſciences to be <hi>quiet,</hi> his deſign is to <hi>maintain</hi> an appetite in you to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
            <p>2. He hides their <hi>graces</hi> from them; they think they have <hi>no</hi> grace at all, or not <hi>true</hi> grace; they have it, there it is, but God ſends it to hide it ſelf behind the curtain; they cannot find it; and then they cry, and their ſpirits are ſtirred up, now their appetite is rowſed; they find an appetite to Prayer, an appetite to Self-examination, an appetite to Chriſt,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55699:66"/> and to Ordinances; God is fain to deal thus with them, to hide their graces from them, and then when they think they are loſt, they go from place to place to find them, and at laſt they come (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> did) to the Temple, and there they find <hi>Chriſt:</hi> This God doth to preſerve and keep up your appetite.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>growth</hi> of grace is hidden and concealed from them: and here they make heavy complaints, and conclude ſadly againſt themſelves: Surely my graces are not of the <hi>true blood,</hi> of the <hi>royal deſcent,</hi> becauſe they do not grow in me; were they <hi>vital,</hi> they would grow; or elſe God hath forſaken me, and I am under his ſore and ſad diſſertion: Thus they lye under the black Cloud; their graces (being <hi>true</hi>) without queſtion do grow, and yet their growth of grace is hid from them: And why doth the Lord carry things thus with them, but to quicken and ſtir up their appetite, that they may have an edg upon their ſpirits to the Ordinances?</p>
            <p>And thus (though under many fears, and much doubting, yet) grace <hi>increaſeth</hi> in them; for as a <hi>lively</hi> and quick appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to the Ordinances is a <hi>ſign</hi> of growth, ſo it is a <hi>means</hi> of the growth of grace.</p>
            <p>4. The Lord increaſeth grace in his people by the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints: <hi>It is not good</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>for man to be alone:</hi> As man is a ſociable creature, ſo grace <hi>loves</hi> company; nay grace <hi>needs</hi> company and ſociety: <hi>Exhort one another daily</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>while it is called to day.</hi> Travellers are ſenſible how dangerous it is to ride alone: Who knows what or whom they may meet with in the way?</p>
            <p>Communion of Saints is a <hi>Divine</hi> Ordinance: Grace cannot thrive well without it, and we muſt not think to grow in grace, when we <hi>will</hi> live without an Ordinance.</p>
            <p>In Communion, there is <hi>Communication;</hi> in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, there is a Communication of Graces, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and Influences: There cannot be a building, unleſs there be a meeting of ſtones, Saints, together.</p>
            <p>In the Communion of Saints, there is a <hi>bearing up</hi> of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As in a Fabrick, one ſtone holds and bears up another; <hi>Bear you one anothers burdens, and ſo fulfil the law of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Communion of Saints there is a <hi>praying</hi> for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55699:67"/> 
               <hi>Pray one for another:</hi> And what an help is this to the<note place="margin">Jam. 5. 16.</note> growth of grace?</p>
            <p>In the Communion of Saints there is a <hi>telling</hi> of one another their <hi>faults;</hi> an opening of the wound, that it may let out<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 15.</note> the corrupt matter; a friendly conviction to nip the ſin in its bud, that it may go on no further; and doth not this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute much to the growth of grace?</p>
            <p>In the Communion of Saints there is a mutual <hi>mourning</hi> over<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 21.</note> one another, a ſhedding of tears for one another, which fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like dew, cannot but moiſten and molliſie the withering herb, and repair decaying grace; Tell me, Doth not this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the work?</p>
            <p>In the Communion of Saints, there is a <hi>reſtoring</hi> of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a ſetting of bones that are out, into joynt again, like curious and tender Chyrurgeons, with gentle handling of the diſeaſed party, not roughly, but by putting him to as little pain as may be (for ſo <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies), <hi>If any be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> 
               <hi>in a fault—Reſtore him with the ſpirit of meekneſs:</hi> And doth not this help to perfect grace wonderfully?</p>
            <p>In the Communion of Saints, there is a <hi>conſolation</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſinners, a providing of Cordials for lapſed ſouls, that faint under the ſenſe of their ſins; an Application of comforts to them under their grief and ſhame: <hi>Forgive him</hi> (ſaith the<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 7, 8.</note> Apoſtle) <hi>and comfort him, leſt perhaps ſuch an one ſhould be ſwallowed up with over much ſorrow—confirm your love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tell me how, Doth not this cheer up grace exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly?</p>
            <p>This is another means whereby God furthers grace in his People; the Communion of Saints: And are ye not now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of your ſelves, that you uſe this Ordinance no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you? Do you not find your graces to wither in you for want of it?</p>
            <p>There are ſtrong Saints, and there are weak Saints, and the weak ones ſhould receive quicknings from the Benign influence of the ſtronger. As <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us of a Territory in <hi>Africk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nat. Hiſtor.</hi> l. 18. c. 22.</note> in which a City called <hi>Tacape</hi> is ſituate; I ſay, in this Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (as he tells us in his time), there ſtood a mighty great <hi>Date<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> having under <hi>it</hi> growing an. <hi>Olive,</hi> under <hi>which</hi> there is a <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> over-ſpreads a <hi>Pomgranate-tree,</hi> under the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55699:67"/> ſhade <hi>whereof</hi> there is a <hi>Vine</hi>—Every one of theſe (ſaith he) live, joy, and thrive under the ſhade of each other: Such is the Communion of Saints rightly planted; a company of precious Trees, where the Olive grows under the Date-tree, the Fig-tree under the Olive, the Pomgranate under the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and the Vine under the Pomgranate, the weak Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of the ſtronger.</p>
            <p>5. By want of aſſurance: I ſay, the Lord quickens his peoples graces, by <hi>withdrawings</hi> of his Preſence, and <hi>interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of black darkneſs: They lye out in a night of ſad fears and wants of aſſurance: Not that God <hi>delights</hi> in theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, but he is fain to do ſo, the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of his Saints call for it; otherwiſe they would be <hi>ſtark naught: They</hi> would forſake God, if <hi>God</hi> did not forſake them for a while. For,</p>
            <p>1. Did they always enjoy Gods ſmiles, they would grow <hi>fearleſs</hi> of God: <hi>Fear</hi> of God is a great preſervative of grace, and antidote againſt ſin: Now <hi>fearleſneſs</hi> of God is a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which the Saints are apt to grow into: As <hi>children</hi> are wont to grow <hi>ſawcy</hi> and <hi>irreverent,</hi> when their Father dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles them too much upon the lap of familiarity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is fain ſometimes by his <hi>frowns</hi> and <hi>diſtance</hi> to take down their ſpirits: So though God be a <hi>Father,</hi> yet he will be <hi>feared: Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 11.</note> And therefore to correct the ſinful boldneſs of his Children, and cauſe them to ſtand in awe of him, he ſometimes ſhuts in his favour, and takes ſtate by concealing himſelf; as the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings ſhunned familiarity, and were ſeldom ſeen, that they might be the more honoured.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fear of God</hi> is one of the <hi>main pillars</hi> of his Throne; and ſo far as he is not <hi>our fear,</hi> he is not <hi>our God:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to advance his fear in the hearts of his people, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his <hi>face;</hi> and where fear grows, grace grows: For <hi>the fear of the Lord, is the beginning of wiſdom,</hi> i. e. the chief or principal part of our wiſdom: The Saints fear of God keeps them from Apoſtacy, <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall never depart from me:</hi> and to quicken their fear, they ſhall ſometimes feel his abſence.</p>
            <p>2. The Lord leaves his people in wants of aſſurance, to cure them of <hi>ſlightneſs of heart:</hi> There is a trifling diſpoſition in the hearts of Saints, they are apt to be ſuperficial in their ways, and this God viſits upon them.</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:55699:68"/>
            <p>They dally with duties, do them as if they did them not; without heart, in a lazy and liveleſs manner: you are in an evil frame of heart, when you can do the <hi>weighty things</hi> of God with ſlightneſs.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>three</hi> evils in a <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>formal</hi> Commnnion with God.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs:</hi> A <hi>ſlothful</hi> ſervant is an <hi>unfaithful</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: He that is <hi>faithful,</hi> doth his maſters work <hi>with all his might:</hi> And certainly a ſlight communion with God, ſpeaks a ſlight love to God: Where then, there is idleneſs, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs, God comes in a way of anger to whip up the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unfaithful ſpirit: and this ſtirs up grace: Negligence and dallying with duties would kill grace; and therefore it is a mighty mercy of God to ſhadow himſelf from his Saints, that they may be more ſerious in their duties.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>other</hi> evil in a ſlight and formal Communion with God in Duties, is <hi>unthankfulneſs:</hi> Duties of godlineſs are not only a debt <hi>to God,</hi> but a reward <hi>to us:</hi> Therefore in ſlightneſs, there is not only <hi>unfaithfulneſs,</hi> but <hi>unthankfulneſs:</hi> Both the Majeſty and Mercy of God is deſpiſed: and can God be well pleaſed with ſuch things?</p>
            <p>3. There is a <hi>third</hi> evil in a ſlight Communion with God in Duties, and that is <hi>unfruitfulneſs;</hi> we get nothing from God in duties, we pray ſlightly, and therefore get nothing by Prayer; we hear the word ſlightly, and therefore profit not by it. Now that the Lord may cure his people of this ſlightneſs of heart, and make their graces grow, he uſeth this diſpenſation, to leave them in want of aſſurance.</p>
            <p>6. God increaſeth his Saints graces by terrors within: he not only <hi>ſuſpends</hi> their comforts, but <hi>afflicts</hi> their ſouls, he writes <hi>bitter</hi> things againſt them.</p>
            <p>1. Theſe rowſe them up to ſeek God: They that ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves loſt, will find a way to God: They that have Hell-fire burning in them, will value Heaven, and pardon, and the leaſt drop of Gods love: Oh! now promiſes are precious, and Gods love neglected, is now ſweeter than the honey and the honey-comb: Now they cry, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Theſe fright them out of their dreams, and carnal ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; as the cry made at midnight; that the <hi>Bridegroom cometh,</hi> awoke the virgins out of their ſleep.</p>
            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:55699:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Among the other diſeaſes of the ſoul, Divine deſertions cure deadneſs and dulneſs of heart: Sometimes <hi>living</hi> men are in a <hi>lifeleſs</hi> ſtate, their hearts are ſo <hi>benummed,</hi> that they ſeem to lye among the <hi>dead:</hi> They can hear the word careleſly, and ſleep out whole Sermons; there is no vigour nor activity in their graces at home, and therefore the Lord hangs their ſouls over the mouth of Hell, and makes them drink of that <hi>red wine,</hi> the <hi>dregs</hi> whereof <hi>the wicked of the earth ſhall</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 75. 8.</note> 
               <hi>wring out and drink them,</hi> that by this <hi>ſtrong potion</hi> he may rowſe them up, and quicken their <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>drowſy</hi> ſpirits.</p>
            <p>3. Theſe terrors work them more cloſely to Chriſt: And for this cauſe God gives his People ſad viſions of ſin and wrath, he ſhakes the ſoul with Earth-quakes, that ſhe may ſtand <hi>faſter</hi> upon her true <hi>Baſis</hi> and Foundation: Theſe ſtorms make their hearts <hi>gather in</hi> to Chriſt: <hi>That I may be found in him,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> The ſoul muſt have ſome <hi>dry land</hi> to ſtand upon; and when the flood of Gods terrors overflow the ſoul, then ſhe flyeth to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Noah's</hi> Dove to the ark.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7thly,</hi> The Lord increaſeth grace in his Saints by afflictions: he <hi>makes</hi> them by <hi>marring</hi> them: Divine Wiſdom works by <hi>contraries:</hi> he makes them ſhine brighter by their <hi>Eclipſes,</hi> and clears up their light by darkneſs, <hi>Schola crucis, Schola lucis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, It is the property of true-born grace to grow the greater by the croſs: As the <hi>laurel tree</hi> is not ſmitten<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin. Nat. Hiſt.</hi> l. 2. c. 55.</note> nor blaſted with <hi>lightning;</hi> no more is heaven-born grace hurt by any afflictions, but much bettered by them.</p>
            <p>1. God increaſeth his Saints graces by ſharp <hi>ſickneſſes,</hi> by diſeaſes unto death, <hi>i. e.</hi> this ſtartles mightily: Oh Lord! thou didſt ſurprize me unprovided; and if thy hand had cut me off with that diſeaſe, my ſoul had been cut off from heaven for ever: This enters deep upon the ſoul, and ſtrikes terrour upon the heart; the Lord (I hope) ſhall never find me ſo again: This ſtirs up thankfulneſs to the Lord, that hath not only (in this tryal) ſaved me from the <hi>grave,</hi> but alſo from <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Sickneſſes deaden the Saints to the world: They that in ſickneſſes, are always <hi>leaving</hi> the world, learn to <hi>dye</hi> unto the world: They have death always in their eye: They ſee themſelves ſtill upon the borders of the grave: They are ever
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55699:69"/> and anon lanching in eternity: and this makes grace grow.</p>
            <p>3. Sickneſſes are ſearchers: <hi>Thou enquireſt after mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 10. 6.</note> (ſaith <hi>Job) and ſearcheſt after my ſin:</hi> When God ſmites our bodies, he ſearcheth our hearts, and makes enquiry in our lives; and now (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>Let us ſearch and try</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 40.</note> 
               <hi>our ways:</hi> When God is ſearching <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> it is high time for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> to ſearch our ſelves; and this alſo makes grace to grow.</p>
            <p>4. Sickneſſes dig Wells of godly ſorrows in the heart: They are (as it were) Gods <hi>Mattocks</hi> and <hi>Spades,</hi> whereby he delves deep into the center of the heart, and digs Wells of repentance, which ſend forth <hi>ſtreams</hi> of confeſſion of ſin, which before would not <hi>run,</hi> becauſe they had no vent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covered and ſtopt with the earth of luſt, and hardneſs, and worldlineſs upon them; but now they find a paſſage: <hi>When I kept ſilence, my bones waxed old, through my roaring all the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 3. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>day long: for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me, and my moyſture is turned into the drought of ſummer: I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged my ſin unto thee—and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By <hi>poverty</hi> and narrowneſs of eſtate: Many men <hi>muſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aquilone max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime gaudent, denſiores ab afflatucjus, lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioreſque, &amp; materiae firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oris,</hi> Plin. Nat. Hiſt. <hi>l. 17. c.</hi> 2. Jer. 6. 22.</note> be kept ſhort and bare, that they may thrive in grace. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, That trees generally like beſt, that ſtand to the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind:</hi> It cauſeth them, to ſpread thick, and more flouriſhing, and makes the <hi>Timber</hi> more ſtrong and ſolid.</p>
            <p>The Lord threatneth the <hi>Jews</hi> with a people from the <hi>North-Countrey,</hi> the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Army, which ſhould carry them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into <hi>Babylon:</hi> The <hi>North wind</hi> winnowed them, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all their Idolatry: They flouriſhed gallantly in Religion, after the <hi>North wind</hi> had blown upon them.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>cold blaſts</hi> of poverty correct pride, and moderate high thoughts: <hi>Make</hi> a man poor, and you make him humble: Pride is an abſolute enemy to grace, and proſperity is the <hi>ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> of pride.</p>
            <p>The <hi>North-wind</hi> of poverty cools the courage, and tames the ſpirits of men; and now they know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>themſelves:</hi> Their Plumes fall, and now they will digeſt a reproof, and ſit upon even ground with the lower Saints: When the world frowns upon them, they ſeek the ſmiles of God; before they were too high for him.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:55699:69"/>
            <p>2. Poverty teacheth them to pray: they can now fall upon their knees: thoſe that <hi>never called</hi> upon God, learn now to <hi>viſit</hi> the Throne of grace; and cry, Lord, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread:</hi> Nay, they long for the ſpirit of <hi>Adoption, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Abba, Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay thoſe that <hi>have</hi> prayed in their fulneſs, now pray feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: They can go to God in ſenſe of wants: before they did not hear nor feel their <hi>own</hi> Prayers: In their proſperity, they did not care what Prayers they put off God with: Now they ſet the higheſt rate upon Prayer, for they are fain to <hi>live</hi> upon Prayer.</p>
            <p>An hungry belly makes a Saint hungry after <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and after <hi>Gods Preſence:</hi> When a mans debts and poverty make him ſay, <hi>I know not what to do,</hi> then his ſoul ſaith, <hi>Mine eyes are up unto thee, O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When a man ſeeth, that God <hi>blaſts</hi> all his projects and endeavours, and that he <hi>ſhall</hi> not be rich in this world; then he looks after <hi>grace,</hi> and ſo a <hi>poor eſtate</hi> makes a <hi>rich ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man for a while aſcribes his poverty to his great charge and family, or to his careleſneſs and improvidence, or to his ſuperfluous expences; and therefore brings himſelf into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower room, and ſaith, I will try <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> way; and he riſeth up early, and goeth to bed late; And now, ſaith he, <hi>I ſhall be rich:</hi> But when he ſeeth all will not do, his good husbandry and pains do not enrich him; let him improve his utmoſt diligence, yet all his care cannot add <hi>one cubit to his ſtature;</hi> then he looks upward, and ſaith, Now I ſee, it is God alone that gives wealth, riches are only in Gods hands; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive now, that God will not have me rich in this world; And therefore, Lord, <hi>Lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me;</hi> give me grace inſtead of greatneſs, humbleneſs of heart inſtead of Honour, God inſtead of gold.</p>
            <p>8. God increaſeth grace in his Saints, by awakening ſin in the ſoul: As long as ſin lyeth <hi>a ſleep,</hi> the Saint thinks it is not <hi>there:</hi> He conceives of himſelf better than he is: A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe lying hid and dormant in the body, is ſuppoſed to be out of doors; we think we have not, what we feel not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God awakens ſin in the ſoul: For,</p>
            <p>1. Thereby it is diſcovered.</p>
            <p>2. Thereby the War is maintained againſt corruption, till
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55699:70"/> it be rooted out: God increaſeth grace in the Saints by their continual War and conflict with ſin: The enemy is <hi>deſtroyed</hi> by <hi>riſing:</hi> their riſing is their ruin: had they lain ſtill, they had lain ſafe.</p>
            <p>What made <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and his people to be carried captive,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 13.</note> but becauſe they rebelled and roſe up againſt <hi>Nebuchadnezzar?</hi> When <hi>ſin</hi> riſeth, the Saint riſeth and gathers forces againſt it; and therefore God awakens ſin in the Saints that they may raiſe Armies, and get new Victories over it: Were there no War, there would be no Conqueſts; did not ſin riſe, there would be no War againſt it; and therefore Sirs, God awakens pride, luſts, and ſins in his Saints, that they may hew them down; ſuch a ſin aſſaults them, and takes the field againſt them, that in a pitcht Battel they may tread it under foot, and make an end of it for ever.</p>
            <p>And therefore I would adviſe you to two Things:</p>
            <p>1. Do not think thou art under the <hi>Power</hi> of thy ſin, when thou art at <hi>War</hi> with thy ſin, and it with thee: When the ſoul many times hath had ſweet reſt in God, then to break his joy again in pieces; Satan hath ſtirred up a ſin to aſſault him, and now he cryeth out, That all his ſweet joys were but <hi>deluſions;</hi> were my ſtate right, ſhould I be thus aſſaulted again? And he thinks he is under the power of ſin, becauſe there is a new riſing of ſin againſt him.</p>
            <p>To <hi>anſwer</hi> thee, thou muſt know, that there is difference between time of <hi>War,</hi> and time of <hi>Victory,</hi> between the day of <hi>conflict,</hi> and the day of <hi>conqueſt:</hi> Now is our day of conflict; and that of ſin which remains in thee, muſt riſe again in thee, that it may be ſubdued: When <hi>Rebeccah</hi> had twins in her, ſhe was <hi>troubled,</hi> and marvelled at it, and went to the Lord, who told her, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger:</hi> So there is <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the Saints, and theſe two are <hi>contrary,</hi> ſo that you cannot do the things that you <hi>would,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>cannot will:</hi> yet ſomething oppoſeth this; well, know it, that the elder and ſtronger, ſhall ſerve the younger: Lord, it ſhall be ſo, becauſe thou haſt ſaid it.</p>
            <p>A man that is at War with another, and is able to raiſe Forces againſt him, hath received <hi>power</hi> againſt him, but <hi>Victory</hi> is not gotten preſently: 'Tis ſo here: <hi>The bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, till he bring forth judgment unto victory;</hi> Though
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55699:70"/> Thou art <hi>bruiſed</hi> in the conflict, yet there's no fear of <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> if <hi>God</hi> will not do it, <hi>none</hi> ſhall do it: Now, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not break thee, [<hi>The bruiſed reed ſhall he not break</hi>], and therefore thou ſhalt get the Victory: only know, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thou haſt <hi>power:</hi> Thou goeſt to all Ordinances, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary duties, thou prayeſt daily, and ſtriveſt daily; and when thou meeteſt no help there, thou goeſt to extraordinary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thou doſt faſt, and lye in ſack-cloth againſt thy ſin, and raiſeſt the powers of heaven, Oh Lord, awake! Awake, thou arm of the Lord! here's a continual and hot War now againſt ſin: And this is the firſt thing I would have you conſider; Do not think thou art under the power of thy ſin, when thou art at war with thy ſin, and it with thee.</p>
            <p>2. The thing I would adviſe you to, is this, Be ſure to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your utmoſt ſtrength, and riſe with all your might againſt the Lords Enemies; I mean your ſins: do not the work of God negligently, which is an accurſed thing, [<hi>Curſed is he that doth the work of the Lord negligently</hi>]; And for this cauſe God caſteth you into ſore ſtraits.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould have done the work perfectly, when they were commanded to root out the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> but becauſe they were ſlack, and did it unfaithfully; therefore God left them as Briars and Thorns, to be always an affliction to them: And this is the reaſon why God leaves ſuch a luſt or ſin in you to be a perpetual ſcourge to you in your boſoms; when you are preſſed to take up Arms for Chriſt againſt the ſins of your hearts, if you fight not with all your ſtrength, and purſue not the Victory to the utmoſt, till you find your Enemies dead before you, God may give you into their hands, to lead you into captivity, and to hold you in chains, that will eat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſouls, and may in this diſtreſs ſtand afar of, as one that knows you not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>9thly,</hi> God increaſeth his Saints graces by the work of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
            <p>Many within a while forget that they have been humbled: Time wears out all thoſe Characters of humiliation, that were at firſt engraven upon them; their <hi>wounds</hi> and <hi>bruiſes</hi> they had at their firſt Converſion, are healed up again, and upon this they have <hi>decayed</hi> in grace, and at laſt become <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>enemies</hi> to the Saints.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:55699:71"/>
            <p>And therefore God (to preſerve his Saints graces, and to increaſe them), keeps up ſtill the life of humiliation in them: As the <hi>radical moyſture</hi> in the body is the <hi>pabulum caloris na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis,</hi> the nutriment of the <hi>natural heat,</hi> and the Oyl is the food of the Lamb, which its light lives upon; ſo humiliation is the <hi>humidum radicale,</hi> the radical moyſture, the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſap, that keeps Faith and Prayer, and the other graces alive: They that <hi>humble themſelves</hi> will <hi>pray, and ſeek the</hi>

               <note place="margin">2 Chr. 34. 27.</note> 
               <hi>and weep before the Lord:</hi> They that are humble, they will <hi>accept of the puniſhment of their iniquity;</hi> they will <hi>kiſs</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 26. 41.</note> the Rod of their correction, <hi>glorifie</hi> his Juſtice, and <hi>implore</hi> his Mercy: The proud man thinks his little, much; the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man thinks his much is too little: The proud man thinks he hath grace <hi>enough,</hi> the humble man thinks he can <hi>never</hi> have enough: The proud man hath high conceits of <hi>himſelf,</hi> the humble man hath high conceits of <hi>God:</hi> The proud man ſeeks <hi>himſelf,</hi> the humble man ſeeks Gods Glory, and therefore his deſires of grace are <hi>infinite,</hi> becauſe no meaſures are <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> to ſerve Gods Glory: The proud man reflects upon what he <hi>is,</hi> the humble man reflects upon what he <hi>was,</hi> that he <hi>was</hi> unprofitable, he <hi>did</hi> ſerve ſin a long time, too long: Many years were ſpent before he was called, and all that while God loſt by him, and therefore now he muſt Row hard, and ply his Oars with quickeſt diligence; he did God much wrong, and therefore now he muſt work and labour hard for him; As <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, that am not meet to</hi>

               <hi>be called an Apoſtle: becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God, I laboured more abundantly than they all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proud man reflects upon his attainments, and what he <hi>hath</hi> done; the humble man <hi>forgets thoſe things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13. <hi>Ad humilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem pertinet, ut Homo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus proprios conſiderans, ſeipſum non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollat: Aquin. 22ae. q. 35. ad.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>and reacheth forth unto thoſe things which are before:</hi> Is it poſſible that grace ſhould not thrive here? Oh! now it goes on amain: The proud man caſts his eye upon his Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the humble man turns his eye upon his Deformities; the proud man looks upon his graces, the humble man looks upon his ſins, and then crys out, Oh! how much dirt and droſs have I yet within me, that muſt be purged out! My ſins out-weigh my graces; ſo much levity of heart in me yet to be mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55699:71"/> ſo much <hi>ſelf will</hi> to be expunged, and <hi>ſelf ends</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned, and <hi>carnal</hi> wiſdom to be diſmounted; ſo much want of <hi>love</hi> to God and his Saints, which muſt be <hi>heightned;</hi> ſo much <hi>ſlaviſh</hi> fear in me, which muſt be turned into <hi>filial</hi> fear; ſo much ſtudying mine own preſervation, more than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt of the Lord; ſtudying my <hi>ſafety,</hi> more than my <hi>duty;</hi> asking how I may be <hi>ſaved,</hi> oftner than how I may <hi>ſerve</hi> God; how little I rejoyce at the proſperity of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> if <hi>my ſelf</hi> be in adverſity; and how little I grieve in the adverſity of the <hi>Church,</hi> if I <hi>my ſelf</hi> be in proſperity: Thus the humble Saint, by <hi>conſidering</hi> his imperfections, <hi>advanceth</hi> on to perfection; by adviſing with his <hi>own wants,</hi> is ſtill draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more water out of Chriſts <hi>fulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>10thly,</hi> God increaſeth his Saints graces, by making <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> to improve and increaſe them: God increaſeth their ſtock by their own good husbandry.</p>
            <p>When the noble man (in the Parable) called his Servants,<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 12.</note> and gave a ſtock of money among them, to traffick with in his abſence; he charged them to improve it to his beſt advantage; and one of them ſaid, <hi>Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds;</hi> and another came and ſaid, <hi>Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds:</hi> So when the Lord Chriſt gives a <hi>ſtock</hi> of grace, and ſets up a ſoul, he looks that your own care ſhould come in, and that by your own good husbandry you ſhould <hi>add</hi> to it: You ſuppoſe the work of <hi>increaſing</hi> grace lyeth in Chriſt alone:</p>
            <p>This <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>is not</hi> true.</p>
            <p>1. It is true in <hi>this ſenſe,</hi> that the increaſe flows only from Chriſt, the <hi>increaſe</hi> is his <hi>bleſſing:</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Paul planteth; and Apollo watereth, but God giveth the increaſe:</hi> 'Tis he alone that <hi>adds</hi> to the firſt ſtock wherewith he ſet you up: None can <hi>create</hi> grace in the ſoul but Jeſus Chriſt: Every addition is a new creation; When <hi>David</hi> (after his great fall) prayed for <hi>increaſe</hi> of grace; He ſaith, <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God:</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> ſtirreth them<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 10. Eph. 4. 23, 24.</note> up to be <hi>renewed in the ſpirit of their mind,</hi> he adds, <hi>which is created:</hi> As the firſt <hi>platform</hi> of the <hi>new man</hi> is created, ſo is every <hi>degree</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>This is the difference between the growth of <hi>nature,</hi> and of <hi>grace:</hi> In <hi>natural</hi> growth there ariſeth out of nature a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55699:72"/> new <hi>addition,</hi> but in the growth of <hi>grace</hi> there is a new <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Thus far, that all your increaſe of grace lyeth in <hi>Chriſt alone,</hi> is true.</p>
            <p>2. But in <hi>another ſenſe</hi> it is not true, that is, without the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour: For <hi>you</hi> muſt act, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may give the increaſe: <hi>You</hi> muſt <hi>work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> though <hi>God</hi> muſt <hi>work in you both to will and to do:</hi> And therefore 'tis ſaid <hi>to you, Add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledg, and to knowledg temperance:</hi> The Diſciples came to Chriſt, and ſaid <hi>Lord increaſe our faith;</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> prays for the <hi>Theſſalonians, The Lord make you to increaſe:</hi> and yet he ſaith to <hi>them, We beſeech YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>, brethren, that ye increaſe more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>11thly,</hi> God increaſeth grace in his Saints, by keeping them awake: The <hi>ſluggard,</hi> and the <hi>ſleeper</hi> goeth behind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, it is impoſſible he ſhould thrive, or keep cart on wheels.</p>
            <p>And therefore God to increaſe their graces, keeps his Saints awake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sleep</hi> is [<hi>Ligatio ſenſuum</hi>] the binding of the ſenſes; and therefore to be awake, is when the ſenſes are <hi>free,</hi> and at their liberty.</p>
            <p>1. Sleep ſhuts up the eye; the man that ſleeps, ſeeth no more than the man that's blind: And therefore God keeps his Saints eyes open to ſee Temptations, and ſpiritual dangers, to ſee the ſnares that are laid for them at their feet; to ſee things <hi>inviſible,</hi> to ſee Judgment at hand, to ſee the Tribunal ſet, and the Books opened, and the Judg ſitting with innumerable Angels round about him; and now <hi>repentance</hi> thrives, and <hi>ſelf-examination</hi> is at work, and <hi>making your calling and election ſure,</hi> goeth on, and ſpinning of <hi>fine linnen,</hi> and <hi>waſhing of our robes white in the blood of the lamb,</hi> and preparation for the <hi>nuptials</hi> with the Bridegroom: While the eye of <hi>Hope</hi> is<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 3.</note> kept open, the man <hi>purifieth himſelf</hi> as Chriſt <hi>is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Sleep locks up the ear: As long as a man is drown'd in a <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>deep</hi> ſleep, he hears no noiſe about him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord (to increaſe his Saints graces) keeps their ear open; they hear the word of the Lord: they hear and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they believe and tremble, they tremble and obey, they obey, and ſet upon action; they read, they run, they pray, they conſult with the Saints, they enquire how did the Lord
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55699:72"/> work upon you? What ſigns and evidences of grace can you produce as fruits of your Election, and firſt fruits of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? When you paſſed through the <hi>new birth,</hi> what were your pangs? How were your throws?</p>
            <p>3. Sleep takes away ſenſe and feeling: The man that is lockt up in ſleep, as he hears not, when you call him, not ſeeth you, though you ſtand before him, ſo he feels not, though you jog him by the elbow: And therefore God (to increaſe his Saints graces) keeps their feeling awake and lively: their ſenſe of ſin is ſtill freſh in them upon their Conſciences; God keeps open their wounds of godly ſorrow, that they bleed afreſh upon every good occaſion: they feel their wants, and ſpiritual defects, their ſpiritual poverty; they feel how little they grow in grace, they feel how weak their ſpiritual life is, how feeble their ſtrength, how faint their faith, how languid their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, how cold their affections are to Chriſt; and are therefore very ſedulous to ſupply what is lacking to their graces, and to be found in an acceptable ſtate at their Lords coming.</p>
            <p>1. They feel the knocks of the ſpirit, and are ready to open unto, and receive him.</p>
            <p>2. They feel Gods retreat, and abſence from their ſouls.</p>
            <p>3. They feel when they work by the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> or by their <hi>own</hi> ſtrength: When they pray in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> or by their own <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>12thly,</hi> God increaſeth his Saints graces, by <hi>their</hi> exerciſe of their graces: <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 24. 16.</note> 
               <hi>have always a conſcience void of offence towards God and towards man. Paul</hi> by <hi>exerciſing</hi> a pure Conſcience, <hi>kept</hi> a pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: ſo muſt every Saint, that would be skilful at his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, be <hi>training</hi> and <hi>exerciſing</hi> himſelf in his <hi>poſtures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. There's no grace the Chriſtian hath, but the Lord calls for its <hi>daily</hi> exerciſe: <hi>Pray,</hi> but how? <hi>continually: Continue in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rejoyce: But when? Alway: <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alway.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Give thanks,</hi> for what? <hi>In every thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What makes garments breed moths, but lying in the<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 18.</note> Cheſt or Coffer? And Iron to ruſt, and the ſtone to gather Moſs, but to lye ſtill? What makes water in a pond to gather Mud, but becauſe 'tis ſtanding water?</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:55699:73"/>
            <p>3. This makes <hi>God</hi> to exerciſe our graces: It may be, <hi>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
               </hi> will not exerciſe grace your ſelves, and therefore God ſteps in, and doth it for you: <hi>he</hi> provides ſervice and work for your graces: And truly, though (when <hi>God</hi> comes to exerciſe your graces) it is <hi>ſharp</hi> for the time, and <hi>tedious,</hi> yet it is gainful to you, and very advantageous: Graces do never increaſe and thrive ſo much, as when <hi>God himſelf</hi> doth exerciſe them, and find employment for them.</p>
            <p>Oh ye Saints! God ſeeth your graces would <hi>decline</hi> and go behind-hand in you, did he not cut out work for them: He brings thee into a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of ſtraits to exerciſe thy Faith: In thy proſperity and fulneſs, Faith in God is laid aſide as uſeleſs; and thou relyeſt upon thine own props, and therefore God plungeth thee into ſtraits, that thou mayſt exerciſe thy Faith on <hi>him:</hi> He loads thee with reproaches, to exerciſe thy humility; he encounters thee with the other affliction, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thy patience: <hi>Poor occurrences,</hi> and trifles not worth the naming, that meet thee every day in thy way, <hi>theſe</hi> diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thee, and make thee <hi>peeviſh,</hi> and then God ſends ſome weighty load of affliction on thee, to exerciſe thy humility and patience <hi>to purpoſe;</hi> ſaith he, I will make thee cry out for <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh ye ſecure Saints! that have laid down your Watch, and are grown remiſs in your walkings, I do aſſure you, God hath ſome ſharp ſcourges and ſeverities to exerciſe you with.</p>
            <p>There are ſome of you, whom I know God hath a ſharp ſcourge for.</p>
            <p>4. Exerciſe of grace keeps Satan out of us, at a diſtance from us, from being able to cloſe in with us: What keeps an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from coming in to a man, but by acting his weapon, and holding him ſtill at the ſwords point? What is it that keeps an Army at diſtance, but the playing of the <hi>Ordinance?</hi> elſe they would come up to the City, and ſcale the walls. So my Beloved, 'Tis the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of your graces, that ſtand between Satan and your graces: The exerciſe of Divine Meditation, keeps Satan out of your Thoughts and Meditations.</p>
            <p>5. Either exerciſe thy <hi>grace,</hi> or Satan will act thy <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> As one Bucket goeth down, the other riſeth: There is a <hi>principle</hi> of ſin within, which (like a malignant party) watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ſuch a time to ſtep into the ſaddle; and it is eaſier to <hi>keep</hi> it down, than to <hi>pull</hi> it down.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:55699:73"/>
            <p>13. God keeps up, and improves the graces of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by giving them diſcontents in the creature: he affords them no eaſe nor reſt in any condition: The Lord croſſeth them of what they look for in this world.</p>
            <p>They deſire ſuch and ſuch a comfort; and if they might have it, oh! they promiſe themſelves much happineſs and reſt in it: Will ye ſee now, how the Lord deals with them, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him?</p>
            <p>Either he flatly denieth them the comfort they deſire, they ſhall not have it: or elſe he gives it them, but with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred croſſes and diſcontents with it: He <hi>imbitters</hi> the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and ſweetneſs they promiſed themſelves in it; and then they cry out, Now we ſee that all <hi>is vanity and vexation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See ye it not by experience, That what outward comfort a Saint delights in moſt, in that God croſſeth him moſt? When they ſit down to feed upon, and enjoy it, the Lord mingleth ſome tart ſauce or other with it, that their expectation is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and find it not what they promiſed it would be to them; like Beer, it hath a tang with it, ſomething that doth diſpleaſe them with it.</p>
            <p>Thus (I ſay) doth the Lord deal with his Saints <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long</hi> to him; their deareſt comfort, he pours ſome or other unpleaſing ingredient into it, they ſhall not have their full plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it, that he may wean them from it to himſelf: Saints, if God hath a mind to ſave you, he'l let nothing go away with your love from <hi>him;</hi> and therefore he will put into every worldly comfort ſome <hi>correctives</hi> to abate your delight in it, and that you may not take up your reſt in it.</p>
            <p>If ſuch an outward comfort be ſweet, it ſhall be a <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryar</hi> to thee, and <hi>ſcratch</hi> thee.</p>
            <p>If another comfort be a <hi>Roſe</hi> to thee, which thou delighteſt to ſmell at, it ſhall be a Roſe with <hi>prickles</hi> to thee; God will make it ſo, that thy heart may be indifferent to it.</p>
            <p>I ſay thou ſhalt have diſcontent in every thing, in every comfort thou enjoyeſt, in every kind of life thou liveſt; the ſingle ſtate, and the married ſtate, ſhall have their thorns and burdens: If thou haſt an Husband, or a Wife, thou ſhalt have them with prickles, thou ſhalt have riches and wealth with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering croſſes and vexations; thou ſhalt have credit with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and biting emulations; thou ſhalt have content in nothing;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55699:74"/> and now grace thrives exceedingly; when the ſoul ſaith, All the world, all my deareſt comforts in the world are but vanity and vexation; now the Lord is magnified, and his comforts are prized, and his preſence is deſired: Oh, ſaith the ſoul! none but Chriſt, none but Chriſt: <hi>It is good for me to draw nigh to God:</hi> And therefore,</p>
            <p>14. <hi>In the next place:</hi> You ſhall find God increaſing his peoples graces, by <hi>taking away</hi> comforts from them: It may be their <hi>diſcontents</hi> and <hi>croſſes</hi> in their creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts is <hi>too weak phyſick</hi> for them; they can digeſt the <hi>croſs,</hi> if they may enjoy the <hi>comfort</hi> ſtill? and therefore God is fain to <hi>part</hi> them and their comforts: Nothing will <hi>divorce</hi> their heart, but the <hi>death</hi> of the comfort: Their heart is wrapt up in ſuch a comfort, and their delights and deſires go out from God to <hi>it;</hi> now the comfort muſt be <hi>gone,</hi> that the ſoul be not <hi>loſt;</hi> their affections which <hi>God</hi> ſhould have, they put them into ſuch a creature-comfort, ſuch a glaſs bottle; now the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels muſt be broken, that all thoſe affections may be ſpilt; the object muſt be removed, that their affections may again be recalled home to God; and now when <hi>nothing</hi> is left them to love, but <hi>God,</hi> oh! the ſoul ſeeth, and repents of its folly, looks upward, and ſpies a beauty in Heaven worth all.</p>
            <p>15. God increaſeth his peoples graces, by denying them peace in the world: This alienates the Saints from the world, and makes them weary of it; and now grace thrives and gets upward: Did the world entertain us with ſmiles, and bid us weclcome; how fond would we be of it? How would it bewitch us? Our houſes would be our Heaven, and our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions would be our paradiſe.</p>
            <p>The worſe the world uſeth us, the leſs we love the world: Saints, you that complain that your conditions are no more quiet in the world, Do you not remember that of <hi>Paul? The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</hi> Truly, well<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 14.</note> met: The world cares not a pin for me (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) and I care as little for the world.</p>
            <p>Sirs, This is that which crucifieth you to the world; the worlds unkindneſs to you.</p>
            <p>The Lord hedgeth up his peoples way with thorns, that while they are ſaluting theſe worldly <hi>Dalilah's,</hi> being prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wounded, they may fall back again into the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55699:74"/> of their firſt Husband: They go away with a thorn ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſides, and then they cry out, <hi>I will return to my</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 7.</note> 
               <hi>firſt husband, for then was it better with me than now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh happy prickings, now grace is revived and increaſed: They cry, Oh ſomething hurts me, the world will not let me alone; and O happy <hi>Oh!</hi> now is Chriſt prized, and his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces valued, <hi>Kiſs thou me</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>with the kiſſes of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 1.</note> 
               <hi>thy mouth:</hi> I went to kiſs the world, I wooed it, and went to kiſs it, and it pricked my lips; Oh Lord Jeſus, kiſs thou me, there are no thorns in thy kiſſes, thy lips hath honey, not thorns in them: When the Saint finds no reſt in the world, then he cryeth out, <hi>Return unto thy reſt, O my ſoul:</hi> The Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and Toſſings of the Sea makes men deſire dry land; the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of the Waves makes them love the ſtableneſs of the ſhore.</p>
            <p>1. Sirs, your want of peace in the world, doth it not make you <hi>keep</hi> peace within? Let me have <hi>ſome</hi> peace (ſaith the ſoul); If I cannot have peace abroad, let me have peace at home; if I cannot have peace without, let me have peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; if not in the <hi>world,</hi> yet in my <hi>conſcience:</hi> Oh, this makes the upright Saint nouriſh a tender Conſcience in himſelf, that having no reſt nor quiet in the world, he may yet enjoy a ſweet ſerenity in his own ſoul.</p>
            <p>2. Want of peace in the world, doth it not make you <hi>prize</hi> your peace with God? Would you ever have prized your peace with God ſo much, had you had no diſtractions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions in the world? I doubt of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixteenthly, Another method</hi> whereby God advances grace in his people, is by reproaches from men: Oh! this is a great Mercy of God to his People, that men revile them, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men hate them: Did wicked men hug you in their arms, you would catch the plague of them; Their <hi>affection</hi> would be <hi>your infection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more the <hi>Tares</hi> embrace the Corn, the more they kill it: <hi>Necat &amp; hedera vinciens</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pliny</hi>), the <hi>Ivy</hi> by clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 17. c. 24.</note> and claſping the Trees, binds them too hard, and haſtens their death: The hiſſing of the <hi>Adder</hi> prevents your being ſtung by her: When wicked men hiſs at you, and ſpit their enmity upon you, the more you run from them: And now grace grows, the Saints ſhun their <hi>company,</hi> and thereby their <hi>corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="138" facs="tcp:55699:75"/>
            <p>The hatred of the wicked makes the Saints flock together; it increaſeth their love to one another: There would not be ſuch Communion among the Saints, did not the hatred of the world drive them cloſer together; and now they grow ſtronger: their <hi>love</hi> to one another, and their <hi>prayers</hi> for one another grow ſtronger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aelian</hi> tells us that the <hi>Chii</hi> had a great Sedition among them,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But the miſery is, you know not how to improve the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of men to the advantage of your graces: They ſlander you to be hypocrites, and proud, and covetous, and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, and that you are ſecretly as bad as others.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, How ſhould we improve grace upon this?</p>
            <p>If <hi>they</hi> judg you to be Hypocrites, and baſe, do <hi>you</hi> judg your ſelves: It may be there is ſome ſpecial cauſe that you ſhould judg your ſelves: God ſuffers other men to judg you, to awake you to ſelf-judging; however make this uſe of it, and you are ſure to be no loſers by the reproach: If they ſay, I am an hypocrite, I will try my ſelf whether I am an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite: If they call me covetous, or proud, I will call my ſelf to an account: Would you not be gainers by this?</p>
            <p>Oh! then get within your hearts, and ſearch them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the Lord, and ſee if there be any way of wickedneſs in you which you have not yet diſcovered; and never be quiet, till you have found out your ſin, or be ſure that you are clear: And would not this be an exceeding gain to you?</p>
            <p>2. And then when you have upon deep ſearch clear'd up your Conſciences, then conſider, that though you are not what they cenſure you to be; yet you are ſinners, I ſay, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners before God: You know your ſins in other kinds are ſo many, and ſo great, that you ſhould bear the more patiently to be hardly thought of, when you know you are ſo bad.</p>
            <p>If you are in truth godly, you have ſeen a ſink of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your ſelves, and have loathed and condemned <hi>your ſelves</hi> often; and do you think much then to be condemned by the world?</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:55699:75"/>
            <p>If you judg your ſelves to be ſo bad, ſhould you be troubled that you are thought by others to be bad? If you condemn your ſelves, is it ſuitable for ſuch a ſpirit that hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning himſelf, to be vexed in that he is condemned by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Conclude therefore, it is no great matter to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>by</hi> the world, ſo long as we are not condemned <hi>with</hi> the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventeenthly,</hi> Again, <hi>yet</hi> God goeth higher with his Saints, he aſſaults them with the reproaches of Saints: Oh! the <hi>godly</hi> wound me, and ſpeak ill of me: If 'twere others, I could paſs it by; but thoſe that are godly are upon me, and whet their tongues againſt me: What ſhall I do now? Is God do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me good by this? Yes, by this, if thou knoweſt how to make uſe of it: How? now judg thy ſelf moſt of all: when the Servants of God think hardly of you, and above all, if it be wiſe and impartial men that are acquainted with you; it is then your duty to be very jealous of your hearts and ways, to fear leaſt you are guilty, and to ſearch the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighteenthly, Yet further,</hi> God increaſeth his Saints graces by Temptations, by all ſorts and varieties of Temptations: And therefore if you would look to grow in grace, you muſt expect and make account of all Temptations whatſoever; I ſay, you muſt look to dwell in the air of perpetual temptations; and ſo have the <hi>four cardinal winds</hi> of temptations to be always (nay, ſometimes at once) blowing on you, and bluſtering about your ears: You muſt never think to be free: you would fain have it always a <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>ſerene</hi> air; but be not miſtaken, look for an air full of windy exhalations; for the end and uſe of the winds, is to open the pores of the earth for fructification, to ventilate and fan the air, thereby to purge it, and keep it from putrefaction, to gather the Clouds together, and then diſſolve them to water the Earth, and nouriſh the fruits of ſeeds, plants, and trees; ſo that as the end for which God made the Winds, is for life and growth; ſo doth he in his Wiſdom make uſe of Temptations to ſerve the growth of your graces.</p>
            <p>For to be tempted, is the Way and Conduct of God over his Church, and over all ſouls, and was a part of the life of the Son of God: It muſt be alſo part of the life of a devout ſoul,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55699:76"/> and we muſt not doubt but God hath great deſigns upon them whom he puts into this ſtate: For as <hi>Gods Power,</hi> ſo<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> 
               <hi>our grace</hi> alſo is made perfect by weakneſs; thence ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth luſtre; God purifies us by contradictions and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; he confirms and aſſures us by temptations.</p>
            <p>You ſhall need to take great notice of what hath been ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are Chriſtians that are of two different Judgments about this point.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Some</hi> expect the way of Religion ſhould be very <hi>facile</hi> and eaſie to them; and that as ſoon as ever they are Saints, they ſhould ſail always with a <hi>ſecûnd</hi> or proſperous wind.</p>
            <p>But they are far deceived, who think Piety grows among Lillies; that the way toward perfection of grace is ſtrew'd with flowers; who imagine nothing but <hi>ſweetneſs;</hi> and that devotion is a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, and conſequently, that there is or ſhould be nothing that is difficult: Which yet they are the ſooner perſwaded to, in that they only ſeek a certain ſatisfaction, and eaſe to their own fleſh, uſing no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but faſtning only upon this, <hi>That it is ſufficient for a man to do what he can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There are others on the contrary, that look upon the exerciſes of Religion, as ſo rigorous, ſtrict, and painful, that they ſay of it, as the ſenſual <hi>Jews</hi> did of the Land of promiſe, <hi>It is an ill Countrey, poſſeſſed of Gyants, and that eateth up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are two different <hi>ſentiments,</hi> lying in <hi>extreams,</hi> and conſequently <hi>faulty:</hi> both deceive themſelves.</p>
            <p>To remedy this, the truth we are to ſay, is, That godlineſs is indeed a lilly, but growing among thorns: Religion hath its thorns, they prick, it may be hurt us, but theſe thorns are laden with Roſes.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi> found God in the <hi>burning buſh</hi> of thorns; ſo a Chriſtian finds God, and Grace, and Comfort, in a Bryar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh of Conflicts and Temptations.</p>
            <p>And as temptation was the life of Jeſus, ſo it is the life of our ſouls; to believe otherwiſe, were to flatter our ſelves.</p>
            <p>And yet 'tis certain, there is much content in this warfare; for the grace and help of God is always preſent, which will never fail us as long as we diſpoſe our ſelves to receive it; in this reſpect it is that Religion is all ſweetneſs, in that we are
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55699:76"/> able to do all in him who ſtrengthens us, in him who comforts us.</p>

               <hi>But laſtly,</hi> God tempts his Saints by Satan, by the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and thence I argue, that God increaſeth his Saints graces by the very temptations of the Devil: God ſets the Devil upon his own Saints, unlooſeth the chain, and lets him out upon them, as a Maſtive, and there leaves them fighting hand to hand: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is a Maſtive in Gods Chain, and therefore could not come out at all to bait us, unleſs God looſe him, and ſet him on us: Was not Satan fain to get leave of God, before he could aſſault <hi>Job?</hi> Yes, ſurely, Satan had his Commiſſion from God to deal with <hi>Job:</hi> The power the Devil had, God puts it into his hands. That part of the conference between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> is worthy your notice; ſaith Satan to God, <hi>Put forth thine hand now</hi>—<note place="margin">Job 1. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and he will curſe thee to thy face:</hi> Saith God to Satan, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> 
               <hi>all that he hath is in thy power:</hi> Satan moved, that God would put forth his hand againſt <hi>Job,</hi> and God puts <hi>Job</hi> into Satans hand.</p>
            <p>Was not our Lord Chriſt led by the Spirit into <hi>the wilderneſs, to be tempted of the Devil?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The other is in the words of my Text, <hi>Leſt Satan ſhould get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</hi>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>What was the</hi> advantage <hi>that Satan was like to get of</hi> them, <hi>and of the</hi> Church, <hi>if they did not forgive him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To lead <hi>them</hi> into ſin: Satan would have made an advantage of <hi>their zeal</hi> to lead them into ſin.</p>
            <p>1. In abuſing that <hi>power</hi> which God had given them for <hi>edification,</hi> to the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of a precious ſoul.</p>
            <p>2. By heightning them up (under a notion of <hi>zeal</hi>) into a <hi>rigid auſterity,</hi> and <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> to their offending bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>3. By making them guilty of <hi>ſpiritual murder:</hi> In whoſe hands (had they gone on) this <hi>patient</hi> had been ſo <hi>roughly handled,</hi> that he had <hi>died</hi> in the cure, and run into <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Their <hi>rigidneſs</hi> towards their lapſed brother: <hi>Satan</hi> would have made uſe of it to <hi>ruine</hi> the Church, and <hi>diſſolve</hi> the Society: It would have bred ill blood in the body, begot <hi>ſchiſms</hi> and <hi>diviſions</hi> among them, offended the <hi>weak,</hi> and made the ſtubborn <hi>more obſtinate;</hi> if a poor <hi>penitent ſinner</hi> may not be received again into the boſom of the <hi>Church,</hi> who would be the Child of <hi>ſuch a Mother?</hi> Thus they would have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, and not without ſome reaſon: They that favoured the offending party, would have cryed down Diſcipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if <hi>paſtors</hi> and <hi>ſheep</hi> be not mutually careful of one anothers ſouls, by Counſel and Admonition, to <hi>prevent</hi> the fall of ſome, and to <hi>raiſe up</hi> others that are fallen; to heal the broken, to ſtrengthen the weak, to comfort the feeble, to cure the wounded; if <hi>all of them</hi> take not care of <hi>every one,</hi> how ſhould that flock ſubſiſt and continue long?</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> thoſe Apoſtles of <hi>Satan,</hi> who were <hi>Pauls</hi> Adverſaries, and the <hi>Goſpels,</hi> would have made a ſtrong advantage to <hi>accuſe</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> and draw a party to themſelves. Thus Satan under the Mask of <hi>juſt Diſcipline,</hi> went about the perdition and ruine not of <hi>one ſinner</hi> only, but alſo of the <hi>whole Church:</hi> And therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, IF</hi>

               <hi>Paul</hi> was not ignorant (here) of Satans device: he knew that as one weed (ſuffered to grow) doth ſhed its ſeed, and beget many: As a ſtone caſt into the water begets one circle, which by multiplication begets many more: So <hi>one</hi> inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſin (tolerated) would beget another, and it another, and that another: or the toleration of that ſcandalous ſin would ſpeak for the toleration of another: If they would digeſt <hi>inceſt,</hi> they would much more in time tolerate and concoct <hi>adultery</hi> and drunkenneſs, and I know not what well: But when <hi>Paul</hi> had wrought upon the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the offender unto Satan, obſerve how Satan doth ſpin a <hi>new</hi> thred of device againſt them, of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in this place. Well,</p>
            <p>You have heard the Doctrine, which is, That Satan is a learned and exquiſite Artiſt in the Trade of deceiving ſouls. He is full of methods and devices: As he hath an heart, ſo he has an art to deceive.</p>
            <p>1. I ſhall diſcourſe how <hi>buſie</hi> and <hi>skilful</hi> Satan is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us. And <hi>then</hi> I ſhall <hi>arm</hi> you againſt his devices: and if you have skill in both theſe, you may walk the <hi>ſafer</hi> to Heaven.</p>
            <p>I ſhall (in the <hi>firſt</hi> place) ſhew you how buſie and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Satan is to undermine you: And that,</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe he is a very <hi>intelligent</hi> creature. He is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and therefore hath <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: As the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> are wiſe to do good, ſo the lapſed Angels are wiſe and ſubtil to do evil.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55699:81"/> The Angels that fell, loſt the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of their underſtanding, not the <hi>eſſence</hi> of their underſtanding: I ſay, <hi>Satan</hi> has loſt the goodneſs of his underſtanding, but not the eſſence of it; he can make pitfolds, and lay ſnares to catch poor ſouls. Satan is a very intelligent creature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He is a <hi>great Scholar.</hi> And then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is a <hi>deep head-piece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He is a <hi>great Scholar:</hi> exceeding well read. Firſt in the Book of the <hi>Creature.</hi> And ſecondly in the Book of the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He is well read in the Book of the <hi>Creature.</hi> He knows all <hi>natural</hi> things with the <hi>cauſes</hi> and <hi>ſecrets</hi> of them, and therefore can work <hi>marvels</hi> and <hi>wonders,</hi> though not <hi>miracles.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is exceeding well read too in the Book of the <hi>Scripture:</hi> He <hi>ſtudieth</hi> Scripture, not to <hi>convert,</hi> but to <hi>pervert</hi> poor ſouls: yet I ſay, he ſtudieth hard the Scripture, and therefore he hath the Scripture at his fingers ends: as you may ſee in his Diſpute with Chriſt: <hi>IF thou be the Son of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>God, caſt thy ſelf down: For it is written He ſhall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is a <hi>deep head-piece.</hi> He hath a ſtrong brain: he is not (as we ſay) a <hi>meer Scholar;</hi> a man may be a <hi>great Scholar,</hi> and yet but a <hi>fool</hi> in other things: But <hi>Satan</hi> is not ſo, he is a very <hi>elaborate polititian:</hi> Eagle-eyed to carry about his deſigns very exactly. I will ſhew you in theſe ſeven follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things:</p>
            <p>1. Satan can trace or find out the <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the heart. He can feel your pulſe, and (as the Phyſitian) can find out your temper: I do not ſay, he knows the heart as well as <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> knows our hearts better than our ſelves: I ſay, he feels the pulſe, and finds out the darling ſin; he ſtudies more our hearts than we our ſelves, and therefore we had need to be wary.</p>
            <p>2. When he hath found out mans temper, his darling ſin, he can lay a bait of Temptation <hi>ſuitable</hi> to it. He diſcerns a <hi>proud</hi> heart, or a <hi>covetous</hi> heart, and then he lays his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to <hi>Harmonize</hi> with it. Thus you may ſee in <hi>Job, Jobs</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:55699:82"/> Oxen were plowing, and the Aſſes feeding beſide them; and the <hi>Sabeans</hi> fell upon them and took them away: and why<note place="margin">Job 1. 15, 16.</note> the <hi>Sabeans?</hi> The <hi>Sabeans</hi> were a thieviſh people (inhabiting <hi>Arabia Felix</hi>) given to Robbery; now Satan finding out their temper, he preſently ſets before them rich ſpoils, theſe are a taking Object: See (ſaith Satan to them), yonder is a brave prize for you, <hi>Jobs</hi> cattel. Satan finding out their diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he preſents an Object to them, which hits it fully: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan (like a fiſher) baits his hook according to the appetite of the fiſh: and as Chriſt took men in their own Element: He appeared to man in the garden, like a gardener, ſo doth Satan, [<hi>Fit fera, Fit volucris, Fit toto corpore ſerpens</hi>], becomes all things to ſeduce all men.</p>
            <p>3. Satan is wiſe and watchful to take the <hi>fitteſt time</hi> for temptations. Thus he ſets upon Chriſt, when Chriſt had faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 1, 2.</note> forty days, and forty nights, and afterwards was an <hi>hungry; then</hi> the tempter came, he lays hold on <hi>this</hi> advantage: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, he would not come till Chriſt was <hi>hungry,</hi> to perſwade him to <hi>turn ſtones into bread.</hi> Oh what a ſtrength had this Temptation from the ſeaſon? Who would not make bread for himſelf, if he could, when he is hungry? Hunger is keen: had Chriſt been full, there had not been ſuch an edg upon, ſuch a weight in the Temptation.</p>
            <p>It might ſeem abſurd to ſome, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould anſwer the tempter, who was not worthy an <hi>anſwer,</hi> but a <hi>check</hi> and <hi>chiding,</hi> becauſe his malice was <hi>incorrigible;</hi> he was <hi>uncapable</hi> of any profit or edification: and <hi>holy things</hi> were not to be caſt <hi>unto dogs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is ſufficient to us, that our Lord <hi>would</hi> and <hi>did</hi> anſwer the tempter. For</p>
            <p>He did not anſwer for the <hi>tempters</hi> ſake, but for <hi>our</hi> ſake. For as he would be tempted only for <hi>our good,</hi> ſo he did <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> the tempter, and <hi>overcome</hi> him in that way (that is, of anſwer) for <hi>our good:</hi> for although he anſwered, none being preſent but the tempter; yet he did anſwer, (and it is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit) for the <hi>uſe</hi> of the whole <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>conſolation</hi> of all <hi>Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus how many doth Satan provoke to turn ſtones into bread, when he comes to them in their <hi>hunger?</hi> Thou art in a ſtrait, like to ſtarve and periſh; turn ſtones into bread, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55699:82"/> is, procure thy ſelf meat and proviſion by <hi>unfaithful</hi> and <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> ways: This is indeed to turn ſtones into bread: ſo he came<note place="margin">2 Sam. 17. 23.</note> to <hi>Ahitophel</hi> (in the fitteſt time) when he was in a paſſion, and ſaw his Counſel <hi>cheap,</hi> and at a <hi>low rate</hi> in the Court: And when <hi>Ahitophel</hi> was not followed, he hanged himſelf, and dyed.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Satan</hi> tempts by doing the like things which <hi>God</hi> doth. Thus he hardned <hi>Pharoahs</hi> heart, (and for ought I know<note place="margin">Exod. 7. 9, 10, 11.</note> hindred his Converſion) by doing works like the ſame miracles which <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did: When <hi>Moſes</hi> turned his <hi>Rod</hi> into a <hi>ſerpent,</hi> the <hi>Magicians</hi> did ſo. And mark what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Pharaohs heart was hardned. Moſes</hi> turned the <hi>waters</hi> of the River into <hi>blood,</hi> ſo did the <hi>Magicians.</hi> And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? <hi>Pharaohs heart was hardned: Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 22. Exod. 8. 6, 7:</note> 
               <hi>brought frogs over all the land of Egypt,</hi> ſo did the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus to blind the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> and take them from the true worſhip in <hi>Jeruſalem, Satan</hi> ſets up a worſhip in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Reg. 12. 32.</note> 
               <hi>and Jeroboam ordained a feaſt in the eight month, on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the month, like unto the feaſt that is in Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So you ſhall find Satan imitating <hi>Scriptural-truths,</hi> but with<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Adams</hi> on 2 Pet. 1. 20, 21. p. 362.</note> the <hi>addition</hi> of his own <hi>lyes:</hi> He had his <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Fabuliſts,</hi> whoſe <hi>Mythologies</hi> went for true reports: that the great Army of <hi>Senacherib</hi> was deſtroyed, both <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> agree, but <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, It was by the <hi>Angel of God; Herodotus</hi> ſaith, It was by an infinite number of <hi>Mice,</hi> which in the night-time did eat up the Leathers of their Armours, Targets, and Bridles, and hereupon they fled.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had the <hi>ſame ſtories</hi> of Scripture, but under <hi>borrowed names,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves: In alluſion to the true Hiſtory of <hi>Jonah,</hi> his fwallowing, and egeſtion by the <hi>Whale; Herodotus</hi> writes of one <hi>Arion,</hi> who for his money being thrown over Ship-board, a <hi>Dolphin</hi> took him on his back, and being delighted with his muſick, carried him to <hi>Tenarus,</hi> from whence he went to <hi>Periander</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> informing him of his received injury, and ſtrange deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Satan</hi> knowing that it was prophecied of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>he</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 35. 6.</note> 
               <hi>ſhould open the blind eyes, and the deaf ears, and make the lame leap like harts, and the tongues of the dumb to ſing;</hi> he feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> and gave out as ſtrange wonders of him:

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Devil</hi> would make them believe, that the <hi>fenſts</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> were derived from the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> when indced they came to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from the <hi>Jews: Plutarch</hi> ſaith, that ſome of the <hi>Jews feaſts,</hi> yea, their <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and the word <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> was derived from the <hi>feaſts</hi> of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> but indeed the ſolemnities of <hi>Bacchus</hi> came from them, being not ſo ancient as <hi>Moſes.</hi> And thus the <hi>Devil</hi> damns many a ſoul, by letting them do the like things which <hi>God</hi> doth in the Saints: Doth a true Saint <hi>believe? Satan</hi> can ſuggeſt a motion <hi>like believing</hi> into the ſoul: Doth a true Saint <hi>repent? Satan</hi> will do the like in ſome of his, and ſuggeſt ſomething <hi>like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> into the hearts of his: and therefore is he ſaid to <hi>tranſform himſelf into an angel of light.</hi> How is Satan ſaid to<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 14.</note> transform himſelf into an Angel of light?</p>
            <p>When he ſuggeſts things that ſeem to ſavour of <hi>Piety, Zeal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Annotat. upon the place.</note> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as if the motion proceeded from an <hi>Holy Angel:</hi> Whereas thoſe things which he ſuggeſteth, as he ſuggeſteth them, tend wholly to Gods <hi>diſhonour,</hi> and the ſouls ruine.</p>
            <p>5. Satan tempts by dropping <hi>good things</hi> into your thoughts, when they ſhould be employed upon <hi>other</hi> good things. Thus when you are praying or hearing a Sermon, there will come into your minds very gracious Meditations and deſires, good reſolutions of doing this or that good work, ſometimes good affections, as of grief for your ſins, and the like, all which were good at <hi>another time,</hi> but not at that time, becauſe the Devil throws them in unto you, to take off your thoughts from the <hi>preſent duty:</hi> He will let your thoughts wander in Prayer, upon good things, that you may be never the better for that Prayer.</p>
            <p>And he will raiſe up good and holy motions in you, whilſt you are hearing a Sermon, that they might divert your thoughts from the preſent Sermon: Here our deceitful hearts will be ready to think that thoſe come from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> (oh <hi>cunning Devil</hi>), but the truth is, they come from <hi>Satan:</hi> for the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath no ſuch office to draw away mens minds from hearing the word, nor to trouble mens minds in prayer, with thoughts impertinent.</p>
            <p>6. Satan makes choice of <hi>ſuch</hi> inſtruments to tempt by, as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55699:84"/> are likely to be <hi>moſt effectual.</hi> Thus (you know) he did<note place="margin">Gen 3. 6. 1 Reg. 21. Job 2. 9.</note> overcome <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Eve</hi> his <hi>ſecond ſelf:</hi> Again, thus he tempted <hi>Ahab</hi> by <hi>Jezzabel,</hi> a prevailing inſtrument. And thus he tempted <hi>Job</hi> by his wife: and thus he tempted <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 16. 22. 23.</note> by <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Satan can make uſe of our <hi>friends</hi> to do us hurt by: He tempts not only by <hi>himſelf,</hi> but by <hi>inſtruments;</hi> and not only by ſuch as are at a <hi>diſtance</hi> from us, but by thoſe who are <hi>neareſt</hi> in relation, and by thoſe <hi>moſt:</hi> He can make a friend, a child, a wife, inſtrumental for our ruine: As <hi>Saul</hi> married his Daughter to <hi>David, that ſhe might be a ſnare to him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 21.</note>
            </p>
            <p>6. Satan tempts us by our <hi>own ſelves.</hi> He makes uſe of our <hi>own reaſon</hi> or underſtanding to deceive our ſelves: he draws <hi>reaſon</hi> out of our own bowels to deſtroy us: and here you have the firſt particular, where you find how buſie Satan is, and how skilful an artiſt Satan is to undermine us: he is a very <hi>intelligent</hi> creature.</p>
            <p>2. Satan is armed with <hi>malice</hi> againſt ſouls. That's a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note place="margin">2 Particular. Pſal. 41. 7.</note> that ſets him upon deviſing devices againſt us: As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>All that hate me, whiſper together againſt me; againſt me, do they deviſe my hurt:</hi> And in another place, <hi>While</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 31. 13.</note> 
               <hi>they took counſel together againſt me, they deviſed to take away my life.</hi> So that hatred and malice is the root of plotting and evil devices againſt one: When we hate one, and bear him ill will, then we ſet upon devices againſt him. Now Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is full of malice againſt God, and then againſt the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>1. His malice againſt God. To tempt men is a pleaſure to his malice, thinking himſelf by this means ſomewhat revenged of <hi>God:</hi> As he that defaceth the <hi>picture</hi> of his enemy, when he cannot come at his <hi>perſon,</hi> eaſeth his <hi>ſpleen</hi> a little: ſo the Dog gnaws the ſtone, that cannot reach the thrower: ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan makes it his work to raze <hi>Gods Image</hi> out of man, becauſe he cannot reach <hi>God himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Satan is boundleſs in his malice againſt <hi>Gods People,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Church</hi> of God. Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul,. God is</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted</hi> (namely by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan) <hi>above that you are able:</hi> As if he had ſaid, Satan would with all his heart lay more upon you, than you are able to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55699:85"/> bear; Satan would break your backs, if he were let alone, but God will not ſuffer it. Obſerve here theſe four things:</p>
            <p>1. Satans extream malice is ſeen in tempting <hi>us</hi> againſt <hi>God,</hi> and in tempting <hi>God</hi> againſt <hi>us.</hi> He doth not only tempt us to ſin againſt God, (that were malice enough) but when we little think of it, when we are aſleep, or in our buſineſs, he is trying and tempting God againſt us: O extream ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice! Thus God himſelf acknowledgeth in <hi>Job, Thou movedſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>me againſt him, to deſtroy him without cauſe.</hi> Pure malice ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up Satan againſt the People of God; though he always pretends ſomewhat <hi>in them,</hi> yet the cauſe is in <hi>himſelf:</hi> and therefore <hi>Satan</hi> hath two names in Scripture, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>tempter.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſlanderer</hi> or <hi>accuſer,</hi> noting his two ſpecial works, <hi>Temptation, Accuſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſolicites good men to do <hi>evil</hi> againſt <hi>God;</hi> hence he hath his name, the <hi>tempter;</hi> and he ſolicites God to conceive <hi>evil of good men;</hi> and hence he hath his name, the <hi>ſlanderer,</hi> or <hi>accuſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. When Satan cannot obtain againſt us, by one means, he endeavours it by another. He will not give off for the <hi>loſs</hi> of <hi>one game:</hi> he is not wont to give his <hi>cauſe</hi> over for <hi>loſt,</hi> becauſe he cannot <hi>carry</hi> it at firſt: he will try, and try again. As it was with <hi>Balaak,</hi> when he ſent for <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe the<note place="margin">Numb. 23. 27.</note> people, and ſaw the buſineſs did not proſper; <hi>Balaam</hi> could not curſe them; he brought him to another place, <hi>Come</hi> (faith he) <hi>I pray thee, I will bring thee to another place: peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it will pleaſe God that thou mayeſt curſe me them from thence;</hi> though you could not do it in one place, you may in another: Satan (if he cannot work his will one way) will try a ſecond or third; and obſerve, that when Satan try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſecond means after a firſt, he tryeth a way more probable and efficacious for his ends than the former.</p>
            <p>3. When a <hi>weaker</hi> will not do it, he provides <hi>ſtronger</hi> means: As God in puniſhing or chaſtiſing ſinners, when a leſſer Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not humble them, he ſends a greater: God comes not only with <hi>another,</hi> but with <hi>ſorer</hi> Judgments: <hi>I F ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will puniſh ye ſeven</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 26. 18.</note> 
               <hi>times more for your ſins.</hi> So Satan, if you will not hearken unto him in <hi>one</hi> temptation, he will tempt you <hi>ſeven times
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55699:85"/> more,</hi> and ſeven times <hi>ſtronger,</hi> as he did <hi>Job.</hi>

            <p>Before he got leave to touch <hi>Jobs</hi> cattel and goods, and to touch <hi>Jobs</hi> Children, Sons and Daughters, here was one greater than the former: for a mans <hi>children</hi> are more than all that he hath in the world beſides: A mans <hi>children</hi> are <hi>himſelf;</hi> in every child is the Father multiplied: the child is the Fathers bowels, and therefore this affliction reached to the very bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of <hi>Job.</hi> Then after all this, he gets leave to ſmite <hi>Jobs</hi> body: <hi>Put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And this is <hi>greater</hi> ſtill than the former: <hi>Jobs children</hi> were near to him, but <hi>himſelf</hi> was nearer: and therefore ſaid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>Touch his bone and his fleſh,</hi> that is, afflict his body; the <hi>bone</hi> and the <hi>fleſh</hi> are the two chief parts, the material parts of the body: of them the whole Fabrick doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>bone</hi> is as the ſtone or Timber in this houſe, and the <hi>fleſh</hi> is as the Lime and Morter, filling of it up: Touch this, faith Satan; and here he aims at <hi>ſore</hi> affliction: for if he had ſaid only thus, [<hi>Touch his fleſh</hi>] that might have been made affliction great enough: But when he ſaith [<hi>Touch his bone and his fleſh</hi>], he aims at <hi>deep</hi> affliction: Touch him ſo, as that his <hi>very bones</hi> may ſhatter, that the <hi>very pillars</hi> may ſhake: Touch him ſo, as that the pain and diſtemper may ſink into his very <hi>bones,</hi> into his <hi>marrow;</hi> the bone it ſelf is a part without <hi>feeling,</hi> yet to <hi>touch the bone,</hi> impotts the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pain</hi> that can be felt.</p>
            <p>4. Satan, if he prevails at the <hi>firſt on-ſet,</hi> in the <hi>beginning</hi> of a temptation, he drives on <hi>furiouſly,</hi> and takes advantage to <hi>rout</hi> the whole ſoul: As a Troop of Horſe, that having once broke the <hi>rank,</hi> goeth on fiercely, hoping thereby to <hi>rout</hi> the whole body; ſo doth Satan: you may ſee it in the <hi>pitcht battel</hi> which he ſought with <hi>Peter: Peter</hi> (you know) goeth after <hi>Jeſus</hi> to the <hi>high prieſts</hi> Palace, there <hi>Peter</hi> una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares doth (as it were) draw out into the field.

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To delay their repentance till they be ſick: When we are ſick, then we will repent: Pain and weakneſs of body is no advantage to repentance, and returning unto God: it unfits the ſoul for action: Hence obſerve what the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, when he reckons up the ſeveral conditions of the Saints: <hi>Is any among you afflicted? let him pray:</hi> [he ſpeaks<note place="margin">Jam. 5. 13, 14.</note> that in general] but ſaith he, <hi>Is any ſick among you? let him call for the elders of the Church, and let them pray over him:</hi> As if he had ſaid, a <hi>ſick man</hi> can hardly pray for himſelf: <hi>Is any among you afflicted? let him pray:</hi> In afflictions a man can pray for himſelf: But <hi>is any ſick among you? Let him call for the elders of the Church, and let them pray over him:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, a ſick man cannot pray for himſelf: he hath enough to do to wreſtle with his <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>conflict:</hi> he hath need to call <hi>others</hi> to pray for him: A diſeaſed body unfits the mind for holy duties: and therefore ſick <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Iſa. 38. 14.</note> is called <hi>chattering; like a crane or a ſwallow, ſo did I chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> The pain of his body wrought ſuch a diſquietneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſedneſs upon his ſpirit, that he could not <hi>pray,</hi> but <hi>chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> or [<hi>like a crane or a ſwallow, ſo did I chatter</hi>], that is, I<note place="margin">Annotat.</note> could not <hi>ſpeak,</hi> but <hi>ſigh</hi> and <hi>groan;</hi> or, I was ſo full of pain, that my Prayers were very <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>ſhort:</hi> not <hi>ſentences,</hi> but <hi>words,</hi> not <hi>words,</hi> but <hi>ſyllables:</hi> not <hi>plain ſyllables,</hi> but <hi>chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings:</hi> How pitiful then are they miſtaken, who put off re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance till their bodies be in pain, till they are ſick or weak? They do it upon this ground, becauſe when the body is <hi>ſick,</hi> they think repentance is <hi>eaſie:</hi> It is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore did <hi>Satan</hi> aim to make <hi>Job</hi> ſick: Satan was<note place="margin">Job 2. 5.</note> confident to trouble the <hi>mind</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> by caſting Darts and Diſeaſes into his <hi>body:</hi> by making <hi>Job ſick,</hi> he hoped to make <hi>Job blaſpheme</hi> and <hi>curſe</hi> God; <hi>Touch his bone, and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> If Satan thought by pain and ſickneſs to make <hi>Job blaſpheme</hi> God, Doſt thou think that pain will be an advantage to thee to <hi>turn</hi> to God?</p>
            <p>It is ſaid in <hi>Revelations,</hi> at the pouring out of the <hi>fourth</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 16. 9.</note> 
               <hi>vial,</hi> when they were <hi>ſcorcht with great heat, they blaſphemed God, and they repented not, to give him glory:</hi> Let wicked men be ſcorcht with a <hi>feaver,</hi> or with a <hi>peſtilence</hi> or <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> and 'tis the way to make them <hi>blaſpheme</hi> God; and therefore 'tis a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55699:87"/> woful thing to put off repentance to a pained body: pain in its own nature, fits us rather to <hi>blaſpheme</hi> and fly <hi>upon</hi> God, than <hi>fly</hi> to God.</p>
            <p>Never think (it is one thing what <hi>God</hi> may make uſe of; but do you never think) to have help for the <hi>cure</hi> of your ſouls, by the <hi>diſeaſes</hi> of your bodies: Uſually we find, that either <hi>ſick perſons</hi> repent not, or theirs is but a <hi>ſickly repentance:</hi> Indeed a long and lingering ſickneſs may do much; there is a time wherein the underſtanding may act <hi>deliberately,</hi> and the work may be <hi>digeſted:</hi> but a <hi>ſhort ſickneſs,</hi> and a <hi>ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> ſuch as it is, I ever doubt of.</p>
            <p>I ſay, Satan tempts before Converſion, namely to hinder us from entring the ways of grace, and to keep us out of Chriſt: For, if we be once in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we are gone from him; he can hurt us no more than he can Chriſt: and you may ſee how far his malice can reach, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents head,</hi> that is, <hi>his power: The ſeed of the ſerpent ſhall bruiſe his heel,</hi> that is, <hi>his humanity.</hi> When thou art once in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he can <hi>bruiſe</hi> but <hi>thy heel,</hi> he may ſtir up <hi>affliction,</hi> bring thee to thy <hi>grave,</hi> but ſhall never bring thy ſoul to Hell.</p>
            <p>At the beſt, pain can but <hi>reſtrain</hi> your luſts, it cannot <hi>heal</hi> them: A diſeaſe can but abate the <hi>acts</hi> of ſin, it can never deſtroy the <hi>life</hi> of ſin: Death it ſelf cannot <hi>kill</hi> ſin: the ſins of wicked men <hi>live,</hi> when they are dead: The <hi>grave</hi> cannot conſume them: nor the <hi>fire of hell</hi> waſte their ſtrength: the ſins of unbelievers ſhall remain, not only in their <hi>guilt,</hi> but in their <hi>power</hi> to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how does Satan hinder our converſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By kindling a ſtronger love in us to ſin. There is in all men by nature a <hi>love</hi> to ſin, and Satan comes and blows that fire into a flame, and ſo our love becomes <hi>predominant:</hi> and afterwards it becomes a great work to un-love that ſin.</p>
            <p>2. Satan tempts the <hi>unconverted</hi> theſe two ways:</p>
            <p>1. By inſpiring his <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> and <hi>Miniſters.</hi> Thus he<note place="margin">1 King. 22. 22. 1 King. 22. 4, 5.</note> deviſed <hi>Ahabs</hi> deſtruction: <hi>I will go forth, and I will be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his prophets.</hi> And again, <hi>Ahab</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:55699:87"/> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> asked <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> (who came to ſee him) whether he would go with him to Battel to <hi>Ramoth Gilead?</hi> Well, the King of <hi>Judah</hi> promiſed the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and told him, ſaying, <hi>I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horſes as thy horſes:</hi> Afterwards <hi>Jehoſaphat ſaid nnto the King of Iſrael, enquire I pray thee, at the word of the Lord to day: Then the King of Iſrael gathered the prophets</hi> [that is,<note place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> the <hi>falſe prophets</hi> inſpired by <hi>Satan] together, about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, and ſaid unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battel, or ſhall I forbear? and they ſaid, go up, for the Lord ſhall deliver it into the hand of the King.</hi> Conſider it ſeriouſly, They that admininiſter the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, are the greateſt mercies, or greateſt curſes: When they drop from their lips nothing but Gods mind, they are mercies; if not, they are curſes.</p>
            <p>2. Satan tempts the <hi>unconverted,</hi> by numbering more <hi>falſe prophets</hi> than <hi>true.</hi> For when Satan cannot act for <hi>Truth</hi> on his ſide, he will act by <hi>number:</hi> He will weigh the balance by number, when he cannot by truth: he will diſgrace <hi>truth</hi> by the greatneſs and multitude of <hi>number</hi> againſt it: for he knows what will take among <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> men: they are carried with <hi>quantity</hi> more than <hi>quality:</hi> What are <hi>you</hi> (ſaith Satan, that are but <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi>) wiſer than <hi>ſo many?</hi> Can <hi>truth</hi> ſit upon the lips of <hi>ſo few?</hi> If it were truth, why ſhould not <hi>others</hi> know it as well as <hi>you?</hi> Why ſhould <hi>ſo many</hi> be ignorant of it? Thus he carried his device upon the wings of <hi>multitude</hi> againſt <hi>Ahab:</hi> to hatch his deſign againſt<note place="margin">1 Reg. 22. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Ahab,</hi> he did ſit upon the ſpirits of <hi>four hundred prophets,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>one Micajah:</hi> ſo there are <hi>many</hi> looſe lives againſt one <hi>Chriſt:</hi> though there be <hi>many</hi> (now a days) that teach men by their words and doings, that men may live looſely; yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Broad is the way to deſtruction, and narrow is the way to life:</hi> So that the <hi>fewneſs</hi> of thoſe that carry on the way to <hi>life,</hi> is a Teſtimony of the <hi>truth</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>3. Satan tempts the unconverted, by putting men out of <hi>conceit</hi> with the godly, that they are <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Satan tempts men <hi>in converſion:</hi> He can play his part here alſo: he is cunning everywhere to deſtroy: if he cannot keep ſinners <hi>from</hi> converſion, he will <hi>hinder</hi> them <hi>in</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55699:88"/> Now Satan temps men <hi>in</hi> converſion,</p>
            <p>1. By putting hard thoughts of <hi>God himſelf</hi> into them; and therefore no marvel if they have hard thoughts of <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men:</hi> When ſuch a ſoul is coming unto God, he is by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>way-laid</hi> with this, namely, that God will never <hi>pardon</hi> him; he <hi>would</hi> repent, but <hi>dares</hi> not: he takes <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>Enemy:</hi> Satan would fain make a poor ſoul that's coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, think that <hi>God</hi> is his <hi>Enemy,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> not ſave him; it is one of his Maſter-pieces to bring the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>good-will</hi> of God into ſuſpition: Oh! ſaith he, why ſhould I <hi>repent?</hi> I ſhall not be <hi>accepted:</hi> and this is no ſmall weapon.</p>
            <p>And thus Satan deals with <hi>grown</hi> Saints, and <hi>ſtrong</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and therefore ſurely the temptation is a ſtrong Engine, it hath more than ordinary ſtrength in it: He practiſed thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Job 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Job, The fire of God</hi> (ſaith the meſſenger) <hi>is fallen from heaven, and hath burnt up the ſheep:</hi> Mark ye, why did Satan conſume <hi>Jobs ſheep</hi> with <hi>fire?</hi> He ſtirred up the <hi>Sabeans</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 14, 15.</note> to take away his <hi>Oxen</hi> and <hi>Aſſes,</hi> and why not the <hi>ſheep?</hi> why, to provoke <hi>Job</hi> (if he could) to be paſſionate againſt <hi>God,</hi> and (for that was his great deſign) to <hi>curſe</hi> and <hi>blaſpheme</hi> God, to beget an opinion in <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> was now his <hi>Enemy,</hi> as well as <hi>Man: The fire of God is fallen upon the ſheep,</hi> thou canſt not put <hi>this</hi> off as thou mightſt do the <hi>other,</hi> and ſay, this is but the <hi>malice</hi> or <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> that rob me of my goods; no, thou ſhalt ſee now, that <hi>God himſelf</hi> is angry, <hi>heaven</hi> frowns upon thee, <hi>the fire of God</hi> conſumes thee: Turn over the Records of all <hi>antiquity,</hi> and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever <hi>God</hi> dealt <hi>thus</hi> with any, but thoſe curſed <hi>Sodomites,</hi> upon whom God rained fire from heaven: Was <hi>God their</hi> enemy in <hi>that</hi> puniſhment? Behold, he ſends ſuch an one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>thee;</hi> though God hates nothing ſo much as ſin, yea no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſin, yet he would fain ſave the ſinner: Now then bring your ſouls to this, either I will be a natural man ſtill, or elſe I will get into <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Sirs, If you live in ſin, you will loſe your ſouls: if you <hi>throw away</hi> ſin, you ſhall be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> into the boſom of Chriſts love.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In</hi> converſion one device by which Satan tempts is, when poor creatures are coming home to God, to <hi>fright</hi> them with fearful blaſphemies. As for example, he will <hi>firſt</hi> tempt or ſuggeſt to thee, that there is <hi>no God;</hi> and this temptation ſprings
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55699:88"/> immediately from Satans <hi>hatred</hi> of God: he would annihilate God.</p>
            <p>But now to <hi>oppoſe</hi> Satan in this his device, how ſhall I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him? Thou muſt arm thy ſelf againſt this temptation, thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Tell him, Satan <hi>thou knoweſt</hi> there is a God: thou wouldſt have me <hi>believe</hi> there <hi>is no God,</hi> and yet thou <hi>knoweſt</hi> that <hi>there is a God: The Devils alſo believe</hi> [that is, that<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 19.</note> there is one God] <hi>and tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. (And obſerve it): in that the Devil tempts thee, that there is <hi>no God,</hi> ſhould be a <hi>means</hi> and <hi>argument</hi> to thee to believe more <hi>certainly</hi> that there <hi>is a God:</hi> Satan would keep <hi>you</hi> from believing that which <hi>he cannot but believe:</hi> And this ſhould be a ſtrong argument to make us believe that there is a God: for <hi>were</hi> there <hi>no God,</hi> the Devil would never tempt to think that there is a God.</p>
            <p>3. Another temptation to men <hi>in</hi> converſion is this, My heart is <hi>hard, I cannot</hi> repent of ſin: <hi>I cannot</hi> be ſorry for my ſins.</p>
            <p>Oh! you muſt venture your ſoul upon <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> for <hi>free</hi> pardon and <hi>juſtification;</hi> you muſt take <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and he will give you a ſoft heart, he will give you <hi>repentance unto life:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 5. 31.</note> You muſt take Chriſt for pardon, and for repentance alſo, that you may be pardoned.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But may I before I repent, take hold of Chriſt for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? May one that cannot repent, lay holy and lean upon Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There's difference between one that <hi>cannot</hi> repent, but <hi>would:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And one that <hi>doth not</hi> repent, and <hi>will not; cares not</hi> to repent.</p>
            <p>1. He that <hi>doth not</hi> repent, and <hi>will not,</hi> he may not take hold of Chriſt, nor lay claim to him.</p>
            <p>2. But he that <hi>cannot</hi> repent, but <hi>would,</hi> he may lay hold of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he may repent: and he will go to Chriſt (nothing ſhall ſtave him off) to fetch repentance from him: I ſay, he may go to Chriſt for repentance: See how <hi>David</hi> did do ſo, <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi>

            <p>There are two ſnares and nets which the Devil ſets for people.</p>
            <p>1. One is, that they hope to be <hi>ſaved</hi> by Chriſt, and never care to be <hi>humbled,</hi> nor to be <hi>ſanctified:</hi> and in this the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi> are caught.</p>
            <p>2. Another ſnare which Satan layeth, is to make men labour for <hi>Humiliation, Holineſs, Mortification, Obedience,</hi> and not labour to <hi>believe:</hi> and in this <hi>well-meaning</hi> people are caught. For the <hi>firſt:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They that hope to be <hi>ſaved</hi> by Chriſt, and never care<note place="margin">Firſt ſnare.</note> to be <hi>humbled,</hi> nor to be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> theſe are ſadly in Satans ſnare: he holds them deadly: for <hi>Faith</hi> which <hi>justifieth, makes holy,</hi> though it doth not <hi>justifie</hi> by its <hi>holineſs: Faith</hi> makes thee a <hi>new creature: that Faith</hi> is none of <hi>Gods making,</hi> that doth not make thee a <hi>new man:</hi> And therefore it was the ſpeech of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> in his <hi>deſertion</hi> and <hi>anguiſh</hi> of ſpirit,<note place="margin">Pag. 114.</note> I will not (ſaith he) derogate from the certainty of ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faith, and the promiſes of the Goſpel, for they are moſt ſure; but yet take heed of relying on <hi>that faith</hi> that works not a <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>unblamable life,</hi> worthy of a Believer; believe me (quoth he) it will <hi>fail,</hi> I have tryed it: and therefore he much commended to them the Epiſtles of <hi>Peter,</hi> which preſs <hi>ſanctity</hi> and <hi>chastity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other ſnare which Satan layeth, is to make men <note place="margin">Second ſnare.</note> dig and labour in the Mines of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>ſubduing</hi> their ſins, and not take pains to <hi>believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Here's labour in vain, for that which <hi>can never</hi> bring thee <hi>Christ,</hi> nor ſalvation, and that Satan knows, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore puts men on it, to make them ſpend time and pains to no purpoſe: he puts them in a way where <hi>Christ is not,</hi> that they may not find Chriſt where <hi>he is:</hi> As <hi>Rahab</hi> ſent the men of<note place="margin">Joſh. 2. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Jericho</hi> away towards <hi>Jordan</hi> to ſeek for the <hi>ſpies,</hi> when ſhe hid them in the <hi>ſtalks of flax:</hi> So Satan ſends men a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling after Chriſt over Hills and Dales, over the <hi>hills</hi> of <hi>Duty,</hi> and <hi>high ſtrains</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>days</hi> of <hi>Humiliation:</hi> And therefore as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Martha,</hi> ſo ſay I to theſe, <hi>Ye are careful about many things</hi> [how to <hi>ſubdue</hi> your ſins, and be <hi>humbled</hi> for them] <hi>but one thing is needful,</hi> that is, to come to Chriſt, and believe in him: do <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>you ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. When ye have believed and received Chriſt, then you ſhall
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55699:89"/> be able to do all things; then you ſhall have, 1. Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Victory over your luſts. 2. Sanctification and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to duty, and not before: Theſe be the Births of believing; you muſt believe before you can have theſe: As a woman muſt be married to a man, before ſhe can have <hi>lawful</hi> children by him: Were it not a ſimple thing for a woman to expect chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>legitimate</hi> by a man, and then ſhe would marry him?</p>
            <p>As abſurd it is to expect, Firſt to have legitimate graces in the ſoul, and then to believe, to be ſanctified, and get victory over ſin, and then to believe in Chriſt; for <hi>Faith</hi> (which doth eſpouſe thee to Chriſt) is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of all <hi>true</hi> Mortification and Holineſs, as marriage is of children: As the Apoſtle tells you, Ye are <hi>married to another, even to him who is raiſed from</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God. Chriſt</hi> is (as it were) the Father of all our graces (of him we received <hi>grace for grace</hi>); and when he hath married us to himſelf, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets them in us.</p>
            <p>Of his grace he conveys grace to us, and he never doth it but by <hi>our Faith</hi> in him: for it is by Faith that <hi>he</hi> lives <hi>in us,</hi> and we <hi>in him:</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> is the <hi>means</hi> by which Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is believed in, brings them that believe in him, to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>And this removes that objection that troubles many, <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 38.</note> and <hi>converſion</hi> is requited to <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin: <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Again, <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may</hi>

               <hi>be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> Once more, <hi>For him hath God exalted</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 5. 31.</note> 
               <hi>with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> How then ſhall <hi>I</hi> believe his promiſe of mercy to the pardon of my ſins, that cannot clear my Converſion to my Conſcience? None can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of God, except they be <hi>born again of the</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here are <hi>two queſtions</hi> conſounded, they muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken aſunder.</p>
            <p>1. What manner of perſons they be whom God admits into <hi>Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What manner of perſons may receive. Chriſt unto <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of life? For the firſt,</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:55699:90"/>
            <p>1. God indeed receives <hi>none</hi> into Heaven, but thoſe on whom he hath written the golden Characters of <hi>ſanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20. 32.</note> 
               <hi>his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance among all them which are ſanctified.</hi> For the ſecond, <hi>who</hi> may receive Chriſt?</p>
            <p>2. I ſay, <hi>any one</hi> (whoever he be) that finds his own <hi>guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and is affected with it in his heart. Every <hi>burdened</hi> ſinner, hearing Chriſt propounded in the Covenant of Grace, with this only condition of believing in him, <hi>may come</hi> to him for life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> is offered to <hi>unregeneraete</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> Help to Faith 80, 81. Ibid.</note> men, who being enabled by Gods Spirit to perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition [which is to believe in Chriſt] Chriſt is theirs.</p>
            <p>A man muſt not ſtay to <hi>receive</hi> Chriſt, till he firſt find in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>regeneration</hi> and <hi>repentance towards God,</hi> which is wrought out of it: but he muſt <hi>firſt believe,</hi> that in <hi>Chriſt</hi> he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promiſed Spirit unto his <hi>new creation,</hi> or <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> unto God: for Chriſt is given, to give us theſe things: he is ſent to <hi>bleſs</hi> men, <hi>in turning</hi> them <hi>from their ſins: And</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 3. 26. Act. 5. 31.</note> 
               <hi>him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a prince and a ſaviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore we are not to look firſt to find Repentance and Converſion in <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and then come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain forgiveneſs; but we muſt ſeek both in <hi>him:</hi> we muſt take Chriſt, that we may have theſe from him: as the <hi>woman</hi> that had an incurable Iſſue,</p>
            <p>1. Believed that ſhe ſhould be <hi>healed,</hi> if ſhe touch't the Hem of <hi>Chriſts</hi> garment.</p>
            <p>2. She <hi>ventured</hi> and <hi>reſolved</hi> in her ſelf to touch him.</p>
            <p>3. Upon the touch, felt in her ſelf that ſhe was healed; ſo poor ſinners that feel loathſom diſeaſes of ſin in them, are to go. and venture to touch Chriſt, and to expect pardon and ho lineſs from him: And therefore ſee your error, you who will not believe, till you have firſt grace ſtrengthening you to duty, and ſubduing ſin in you: if you could clear up your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and find theſe things in you, then you could believe, and not elſe; and therefore thou muſt firſt believe in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou canſt clear up thy Converſion to thee: To anſwer
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55699:90"/> this Branch, how ſhall I believe, till I clear up my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a double Act of Faith.</p>
            <p>1. There is (indeed) an act of <hi>Faith</hi> which cannot be had<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Arcker,</hi> P. 30.</note> till this be had, which <hi>Divines</hi> call the <hi>reflect act:</hi> where by a ſoul believes that it doth believe, believes that it is in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belives that it is in a ſaved condition; before <hi>this act</hi> can be, there muſt be <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> and tryal of our graces. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether ye be in the faith: prove your own</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> 
               <hi>ſelves: know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi> This act <hi>preſuppoſeth</hi> Faith, and is a knowing, that we <hi>have</hi> Faith: This is not the <hi>neceſſary means</hi> to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but to <hi>aſſurance</hi> and <hi>comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There is another act of <hi>Faith,</hi> namely the <hi>direct act,</hi> which is believing: not a believing that <hi>I do believe;</hi> nor a believing that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is mine:</hi> but a believing <hi>on</hi> Chriſt, that Chriſt <hi>may</hi> be mine, and that <hi>I may</hi> be ſaved and ſanctified by him: and this muſt be before we <hi>can</hi> repent: we muſt not ſtay from <hi>this act</hi> of Faith, till we can clear up our Converſion to us; but <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt, that we <hi>may</hi> love God, and clear up our Converſion to our ſelves: For (mark you) <hi>Faith</hi> is one <hi>part</hi> or <hi>grace</hi> of thy Converſion: Thou canſt not clear up thy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>till</hi> thou doſt believe; ſurely, then thou muſt <hi>firſt believe</hi> alſo in Chriſt, as well as <hi>repent,</hi> that thou mayſt clear up thy converſion to thy ſoul. And therefore when Satan ſhall tempt thee, what <hi>haſt thou to do</hi> to caſt thy ſelf upon Chriſt, ſeeing thou knoweſt not that he is thine? What <hi>right</hi> haſt thou to put thy ſelf on Chriſt, and art not ſure he is thine? Oh, ſaith a ſoul, if I might truſt my ſelf on Chriſt, I would.</p>
            <p>Thou mayſt caſt thy ſoul upon Chriſt, <hi>before</hi> thou knoweſt<note place="margin">Note.</note> him to be thine: Obſerve, there is a twofold truſting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon Chriſt: 1. The one is at a venture, without a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> p. 20.</note> of an Intereſt in him, grounded on Gods <hi>free offer</hi> of him to all ſorts of people: This is the ground of our firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, on our firſt coming to him, and entertaining of him; for if this were not, people would never receive him: This ſeems to be no more than a confidence in his <hi>ability</hi> and <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to ſave all that come to him: Thus the <hi>man</hi> that had the <hi>leproſie,</hi> came and caſt himſelf on Chriſt at a <hi>venture:</hi> he knew that Chriſt <hi>could</hi> heal him: and therefore faith he, <hi>Lord, if thou
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55699:91"/> wilt, thou canſt make me clean.</hi> He is not <hi>ſure</hi> that Chriſt <hi>would</hi> heal him, only makes a <hi>venture</hi> upon the <hi>pleaſure</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of Chriſt to heal him.</p>
            <p>2. The other is a more <hi>certain</hi> thing, grounded on the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of an Intereſt in Chriſt: Becauſe a ſoul <hi>knows</hi> it hath Chriſt for its own. therefore it reſts on him confidently for ſalvation. This [<hi>truſt</hi>] follows the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of our believing, and is a <hi>further act</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> of Faith, and comes after our <hi>coming to</hi> him, and <hi>receiving</hi> of him: <hi>The Lord is my rock, and my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm. 18. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and my deliverer: My God, my ſtrength in whom I will truſt; my buckler, and the horn of my ſalvation, and my tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O my God, I truſt in thee, let me not be aſhamed: let not mine</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm. 25. 2.</note> 
               <hi>enemies triumph over me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>poor ſinners,</hi> let me (oh let me) invite you to Jeſus Chriſt: I tell you, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> by Chriſt, are free for any perſon whatſoever, to obtain by believing: See <hi>John 6. 35, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me, ſhall never hunger; and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt: [He that cometh, he that believeth</hi>] that is, <hi>any one</hi> that <hi>cometh, any one</hi> that <hi>believeth:</hi> It is an <hi>indefinite propoſition,</hi> and is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to an <hi>univerſal:</hi> It is as much as to ſay, <hi>whoſoever comes;</hi> as it is elſewhere expreſſed, [<hi>That whoſoevrr believeth in him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life</hi>] that is, any perſon whoſoever may [upon believing] obtain Chriſt and Life by him: The meaning is not only, that Chriſt is <hi>free</hi> for all ſorts of people (for all ſorts of people ſhall actually have Chriſt, becauſe God hath his <hi>elect</hi> of all ſorts, both <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>rich, bond</hi> and <hi>free, Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> young and old, men and women, wiſe and fooliſh, one nation and another); but that there is no particular perſon in the world (to whom the Goſpel comes) who may not <hi>by believing</hi> have Chriſt and Salvation by him: Chriſt is ſo freely tendered to all comers, to all receivers, to all that believe in him, that there is no perſon of any Countrey or Condition, of any Age or Sex, or Sins whatſoever, but by <hi>believing</hi> he may have Chriſt, and Grace, and Holineſs by him.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>typified</hi> by the years of <hi>Jubilee:</hi> In thoſe years any ſervant of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> might go from his maſter, and be ſet free, if he would accept of it: which did teach and typifie, that any perſon whoſoever, that is by nature a ſervant unto
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55699:91"/> 
               <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> might <hi>go out,</hi> be ſet <hi>free</hi> by Chriſt under the Goſpel, if he would accept of it: for the years of <hi>freedom,</hi> and of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> typified the year of <hi>grace</hi> by Chriſt, as you may ſee in <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 19, where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid <hi>to preach</hi> [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>],<note place="margin">Ainſworth.</note> 
               <hi>the acceptable year of the Lord,</hi> that is, the <hi>Jubilee:</hi> for he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Lev. 25. 10.</note> in the laſt <hi>Jubilee</hi> that ever the land had, ſet all free <hi>for ever</hi> that would receive him. So the <hi>brazen ſerpent</hi> was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure<note place="margin">Numb. 21. 8, 9.</note> of Chriſt: Now the law of the brazen ſerpent was this, That if a Serpent had bitten any man, when he <hi>beheld</hi> the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of braſs, he lived: Every one (ſaith God) that is bitten, when he looks upon it, ſhall live. What's the meaning of this? That <hi>whoſoever believes in Chriſt</hi> (mark ye, whoſoever, any<note place="margin">Joh 3. 14, 15.</note> one, every one that will look upon him, and believe in him) <hi>ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life,</hi> as himſelf expounds it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>brazen ſerpent</hi> was free for any <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that was ſtung, any one might go and look on't, and be healed; ſo Chriſt is free for <hi>any ſinner</hi> that would be healed, as he explains it: <hi>God ſo loved the world</hi> (that is, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as <hi>Jews</hi>), <hi>that whoſoever believes in him, ſhall not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 16. John 12. 32. Mark 16. 15. Verſ. 16.</note> 
               <hi>life.</hi> And in another place, <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me:</hi> And therefore Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points his Diſciples to preach the Goſpel to <hi>every creature</hi> (that is, to every man and woman ye meet with, to any <hi>Gentile,</hi> as well as to any <hi>Jew,</hi>) and then adds, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved. Chriſt</hi> then (and <hi>ſalvation</hi> by Chriſt) is <hi>free</hi> for any perſon, if he will believe.</p>
            <p>Indeed where the Goſpel is not preached, the people are not commanded to believe; and ſo obedience cannot be <hi>exacted</hi> from them, nor they <hi>puniſh't</hi> for the want of it: yet the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> of mercy and pardon given out, is no way <hi>limited</hi> [in regard of <hi>perſons</hi>] but tenders mercy and pardon without <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction</hi> of perſons upon believing: and therefore where-ever it comes, it offers Chriſt and Salvation free for every perſon of them whatſoever, to be obtained by believing.</p>
            <p>In a word, this was typified by the Proclamation of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> ye know their coming out of <hi>Babylon</hi> was a figure of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">2 Chr. 36. 23.</note> out of our <hi>ſpiritual captivity:</hi> Now the Proclamation of <hi>Cyrus</hi> ran thus, <hi>Who is there among you of all his people? The</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Lord his God be with you, and let him go up.</hi> Like that in the <hi>Revelations, Whoſoever will, let him drink of the water of life freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:55699:92"/>
            <p>Any <hi>Jew</hi> might have liberty and freedom from captivity, upon the terms of accepting it, for it was granted to <hi>all</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to depart, that would depart: Now, though it is true, <hi>all</hi> did not <hi>take</hi> it, and ſo were not delivered; yet freedom was <hi>free</hi> for every one that would <hi>accept</hi> it.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>ſinners,</hi> I do here invite ye <hi>all</hi> to come to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not only for <hi>pardon,</hi> but for <hi>grace,</hi> and for <hi>converſion</hi> and <hi>repentance:</hi> It is true, he will never give you pardon <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> converſion, but he will give you <hi>converſion for</hi> pardon: Do not keep off from Chriſt, <hi>till</hi> ye are converted; but go to Chriſt <hi>for</hi> converſion; he will receive you all, if you will all go to him.</p>
            <p>I am a moſt <hi>loathſom</hi> creature, a moſt loathſom wretch: and<note place="margin" type="runSum">Object.</note> will God look on me? will he love me if I go to him? May ſuch a vile loathſom ſinner as I go to ſo a Holy God? will God put me into his boſom? And therefore when a poor ſoul is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſee his ſin, he is at a ſtand, he dares not go and converſe with God for a pardon: Arm thy ſelf againſt this Temptation, in theſe following things I ſhall give you.</p>
            <p>1. Therefore if thou art <hi>loathſom,</hi> thou haſt the more need<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> to go to God, that thou mayſt be <hi>cleanſed:</hi> becauſe thou art loathſom, thou haſt the more need to fly to him: Thy <hi>foulneſs</hi> and <hi>loathſomneſs</hi> ſhould not <hi>stave</hi> thee off from Chriſt, but <hi>drive</hi> thee unto Chriſt: becauſe men have <hi>filthy</hi> diſeaſes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go unto the <hi>Bath:</hi> becauſe <hi>Naaman</hi> had a <hi>leproſie,</hi> therefore he went and waſhed in <hi>Jordan:</hi> ſo becauſe thou haſt dirt on thy ſoul, go to the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to waſh thee.</p>
            <p>2. Though God be <hi>holy,</hi> yet he will receive <hi>loathſom</hi> ſinners when they come to him, that they may be purged: As when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cryed out, <hi>Wo unto me, I am undone, becauſe I am a man</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 5.</note> 
               <hi>of unclean lips. Thou</hi> thinkeſt thy ſelf undone (becauſe thou art <hi>unclean</hi>) if thou <hi>goeſt</hi> to God; and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf undone (becauſe he was <hi>unclean</hi>) in that God <hi>came</hi> to him: But what then? what was the iſſue? <hi>Then flew one of the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar; and he laid it upon my mouth, and ſaid, Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and thy ſin purged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſaiah</hi> crys out, <hi>I am undone, becauſe I have ſeen the Lord, and am unclean:</hi> But the <hi>Angel</hi> ſaith, Be of good cheer, <hi>thine
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55699:92"/> iniquity is taken away, and thy ſin purged.</hi> Soul, thou ſayſt thou art unclean, but wouldſt thou be purged? I dare not go to God, becauſe I am unclean, but wouldſt thou be purged? Then thou ſhalt have a <hi>live cole</hi> from his <hi>altar,</hi> a <hi>holy cole</hi> dropt down from heaven: <hi>He will baptize thee with the holy ghoſt, and with fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If <hi>loathſomneſs</hi> of ſin ſhould keep us off from going to God, then <hi>none</hi> ſhould ever be ſaved: becauſe loathſomneſs and uncleanneſs is the ſtate of every man: But we ſee God hath entertained <hi>loathſom ſinners,</hi> ſay they, why not <hi>me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Thou art loathſom and filthy by ſin; well, <hi>thou</hi> canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cleanſe <hi>thy ſelf: thou</hi> art not able to put beauty on thine own ſoul; <hi>thou</hi> canſt not <hi>thy ſelf</hi> waſh one drop of dirt off thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore ſurely thou <hi>mayſt</hi> and <hi>muſt</hi> go to Chriſt, that <hi>he</hi> may cleanſe thee, elſe it will never be done: As the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>all ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>God ſaith in one place,</hi> He deſires not the death of a ſinner: <hi>and yet</hi> he hath appointed <hi>men to damnation. How can God be</hi> juſt <hi>in this? God hath</hi> appointed <hi>all things from eternity: If he hath appointed</hi> me <hi>to ſalvation, I</hi> ſhall <hi>be ſaved; and if God hath appointed me to damnation, I</hi> ſhall <hi>be damned, whatever I do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou art not to look to Gods <hi>Appointments,</hi> but to Gods <hi>Commandments.</hi> God doth not firſt ſhew people that he hath <hi>elected</hi> them, and then and thereby <hi>perſwade</hi> and bring them to <hi>believe:</hi> But election is concealed as a ſecret thing: and by Gods offering Chriſt freely to every one to be had by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his free offer doth encourage them to believe; and God giving them the gift of Faith, they believe, and come to know that they are elected unto life eternal.</p>
            <p>There was never in the <hi>Divine will,</hi> any ſuch decree of damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any man, though he ſhould believe and live holy: yea, God hath <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> and <hi>publiſhed</hi> unto all men a quite <hi>contrary</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that <hi>whoſoever believeth in his Son, ſhall not periſh, but have</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You muſt lay hold on Chriſt, and hang there, and continue hanging there.</p>
            <pb n="170" facs="tcp:55699:93"/>
            <p>Object. <hi>But I ſhall never hold out: It is to no purpoſe at all for me to lay hold on Chriſt, for I ſhall not hold my hold, I ſhall be beaten off again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is true, you ſhould be beaten off again, you could not hold your hold, did you lay hold either <hi>by</hi> your own ſtrength, or <hi>upon</hi> your ſtrength? But when you lay hold on Chriſt, you are kept not by <hi>your own power</hi> but <hi>by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</hi> When <hi>you</hi> lay hold<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> on <hi>Chriſt, Chriſt</hi> layeth hold on <hi>you,</hi> and keeps you ſafe by <hi>his power</hi> for heaven: before a man caſts himſelf upon Chriſt, or is in Chriſt, he is his own keeper, and therefore hath but a poor keeper.</p>
            <p>2. Another ſoul-ſtaying argument to aſſure thee of thy keeping, thy <hi>perſeverance,</hi> is this, When once a ſoul is taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, it hath not only <hi>all ſins paſt</hi> pardoned, but alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don laid up for <hi>all ſins to come: There is forgiveneſs with thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 130. 4.</note> that is, there's a <hi>perpetual ſtock</hi> of pardon going in God for all our <hi>daily</hi> ſinning; and therefore doth Chriſt bid us <hi>ſtill</hi> pray, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> becauſe there lye pardons with God <hi>ready</hi> before-hand for all ſins that we <hi>do act,</hi> as well as for what we <hi>have acted.</hi> And for <hi>all that is to come,</hi> as well as for that which <hi>is paſt:</hi> And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> tells you, <hi>There is no</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> 
               <hi>condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that is, after they are <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> there is no inſtant of time, wherein it can be ſaid, that they are under the ſentence of <hi>Condemnation:</hi> Now were it not that there is pardon laid in before-hand for all ſin that is to come, it might, upon every acting of a new ſin, be ſaid, that now they are under condemnation: for if the <hi>leaſt ſin</hi> be not <hi>pardoned,</hi> there is <hi>condemnation:</hi> but this cannot be.</p>
            <p>3. Perſeverance is a gift that is purchaſed by Chriſt. Chriſt hath as truly and as really laid down his blood to purchaſe thy <hi>perſeverance</hi> as thy <hi>pardon:</hi> and therefore canſt thou be ſure of any thing by vertue of Chriſts <hi>purchaſe?</hi> thou mayſt he <hi>as ſure</hi> of perſeverance. God knew at firſt, that thou couldſt no more <hi>keep</hi> thine hold on Chriſt, than thou couldſt at firſt <hi>lay</hi> thine hold <hi>on</hi> Chriſt: And therefore,</p>
            <p>To you that mind not Chriſt at all, but are ſtill bent upon your luſts, and ſins, and will not let him rule over you, oh <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> Chriſt, be exhorted to <hi>come in,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> in him: Elſe,</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:55699:93"/>
            <p>1. You ſhall have as much <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as of <hi>God:</hi> and as much <hi>danger</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as from <hi>God:</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> will be angry with you, as well as <hi>God: Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and ye</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>periſh from the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Such ſhall not only <hi>periſh,</hi> but periſh <hi>worſe</hi> than others; they are dead <hi>already,</hi> but ſhall dye <hi>worſe:</hi> they are faln in <hi>Adam,</hi> but ſhall fall <hi>further: And Simeon bleſſed them, and</hi>

               <hi>ſaid unto Mary his mother: behold this child is ſet for the fall and riſing again of many in Iſrael, and for a ſign which ſhall be</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 12, 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>ſpoken againſt.</hi> One Text more, <hi>And when ye come into an houſe, ſalute it. And whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that houſe or city, ſhake off the duſt of your feet. Verily, I ſay unto you, It ſhall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.</hi> And thus I have ſhewed you how Satan hinders thee in converſion, by tempting thee, that thou canſt not believe thou art dead in ſin; arm thy ſelf againſt this temptation thus: I know I cannot belleve of my ſelf. And this is the firſt thing thou muſt do, namely, to believe that thou canſt not believe of thy ſelf: and thus thou mayſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoot Satan in his own Bow: and when thou ſeeſt thy ſelf ſo loſt, that thou canſt not believe of thy ſelf, thou art a ſtep in thy way to heaven: And know this, that it is the condition of all, till they have new hearts and new ſpirits.</p>
            <p>And now obſerve; you that will not believe till you are ſanctified, and find ſomething in your ſelves.</p>
            <p>1. You keep your ſelves off from believing: for you cannot believe that Chriſt is <hi>yours,</hi> till you believe <hi>in</hi> Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis <hi>pride</hi> in you, that you will not have all ground of <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> to be in <hi>God,</hi> and none in <hi>your ſelf:</hi> For (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it) you will ground <hi>your ſalvation</hi> only on Chriſt; but you muſt ſee <hi>ſomewhat</hi> in your ſelves, before you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>3. You Eclipſe the ſhining forth of Gods <hi>free grace:</hi> you darken its Beams: for Gods grace is free grace: now whilſt ye will not <hi>believe,</hi> but firſt will be able to <hi>do</hi> ſomewhat, you make not <hi>Chriſt</hi> nor <hi>Juſtification</hi> a free gift; nor can it be free grace in God: and ſo whilſt you do not ſee Gods <hi>free grace,</hi> you do not <hi>exalt</hi> him, nor magnifie him ſo much as you ſhould.</p>
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:55699:94"/>
            <p>4. It is a <hi>darkning</hi> of Gods Truth, for you dare not <hi>venture</hi> yours ſouls on Gods <hi>bare word,</hi> but you muſt ſee ſomewhat <hi>done in</hi> you, before you will <hi>credit</hi> him: for though he ſaith, that whoſoever <hi>comes</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>believes</hi> in him, ſhall be <hi>ſaved</hi> and <hi>ſanctified,</hi> yet you will not <hi>believe,</hi> till ye find your ſelves <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and ſo dare not truſt his <hi>word;</hi> and therefore it is that the Scripture makes an unbeliever, to make God a<note place="margin">1 John 5. 10.</note>

            <p>Oh then, be exhorted to <hi>believe:</hi> for you that believe but <hi>weakly,</hi> oh believe <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> your Faith: for you that believe but weakly, you wrong <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>your ſelves</hi> very much, as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> were not as good to <hi>help</hi> you, as the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> was to <hi>hurt</hi> you</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Look for a day of Temptation: For,</p>
            <p>1. Man is <hi>born</hi> to temptations. <hi>Although affliction cometh not forth of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 5. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>ground: Yet man is born unto trouble, as the ſparks fly upward. Mariners</hi> that go in Ships on the Sea, look for <hi>ſtorms:</hi> This world is a Sea of troubles: Travellers look for thieves and encounters.</p>
            <p>This life is the <hi>Field</hi> of tryals, and therefore you muſt look for <hi>Battels:</hi> Soldiers in the field ſtand in <hi>Battalia;</hi> whilſt you are in <hi>this world,</hi> you are in your <hi>enemies Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Temptations <hi>muſt</hi> come. <hi>Jeſus was led up of the ſpirit</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> 
               <hi>into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil: for there must be alſo hereſies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Prepare</hi> for a day of Temptation. Remember <hi>Prov. 24. 10, If thou faint in the day of adverſity, thy ſtrength is ſmall.</hi> 1. Prepare for <hi>inward</hi> temptations: Fears <hi>within,</hi> 2. Prepare for <hi>outward</hi> temptations, frightnings <hi>without.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Prepare for <hi>outward</hi> temptations from the world. <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but becauſe ye</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 15. 19.</note> 
               <hi>are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55699:94"/> the world hateth you:</hi> and Satan will tempt ye <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> the world.</p>
            <p>1. It is a <hi>dark</hi> day. <hi>Afflictions</hi> are called <hi>darkneſs:</hi> and darkneſs is terrible: the night is doleful and uncomfortable: Oh! get <hi>light</hi> in this dark night: Firſt, The light of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to ſee your way. Secondly, the light of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> and <hi>peace:</hi> this will <hi>guide</hi> you and <hi>uphold</hi> you.</p>
            <p>2. It is a <hi>ſtrong</hi> day. <hi>We wreſtle not with fleſh and blood</hi> [that's but <hi>weak] but with principalities and powers:</hi> Satan is ſtrong, and Temptations are ſtrong, eſpecially when we are weak: and therefore ſtore up ſtrength.</p>
            <p>1. The ſtrength of <hi>God,</hi> and the ſtrength of <hi>Chriſt: I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Feed upon the <hi>preſent ordinances</hi> of Chriſt. Concoct them, and turn them into nutriment: Chriſt <hi>fed</hi> the people, <hi>leſt</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>they ſhould faint in the way:</hi> If you <hi>hear</hi> the word, but <hi>feed</hi> not <hi>on</hi> the word, you will faint in the way: Rebuke your ſelves, that you have not fed ſo heartily upon the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt: O repent, and whet up your appetites: now get good ſtomachs to the word of life: What the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Lord ſaid to <hi>Elijah,</hi> ſo ſay I to <hi>yon, Ariſe</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 19. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>and eat, becauſe the journey is too great for thee: And he aroſe, and did eat and drink, and went in the ſtrength of that meat forty days and forty nights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Get the <hi>ſpirit</hi> within you: <hi>Ye are of God, little children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 4.4.</note> 
               <hi>and have overcome them, becauſe greater is he that is in you, than be that is in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Get <hi>humility:</hi> there is great ſtrength in humility: The humbled Chriſtian is the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian: An <hi>humble</hi> heart will bear a <hi>great</hi> affliction, when a <hi>proud</hi> heart cannot bear the <hi>leaſt: Let a man deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and follow me:</hi> Self-denial is humility, and the ſelf-denying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will be able to take up the Croſs, and carry it after Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Prepare, as for outward, ſo for <hi>inward</hi> Temptations: <hi>Outward tryals</hi> bring <hi>inward Temptations</hi> along with them.</p>
            <p>1. Temptations to <hi>doubt</hi> of Gods love, as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid [when the <hi>Angel</hi> told him, <hi>The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour]. Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 6. 13.</note> 
               <hi>this befaln us? And where be all his miracles which our Fathers
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55699:95"/> told us of, ſaying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the Lord hath forſaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Temptations to <hi>caſt off</hi> God. <hi>Then ſaid his wife unto him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Doſt thou still retain thine integrity? Curſe God and dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Temptations to <hi>unbelief:</hi> When <hi>poverty</hi> and <hi>want</hi> of all things come upon you, <hi>can</hi> God, or <hi>will</hi> God ſuſtain me? When I have nothing of mine own, <hi>ſhall,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> I live upon the air? <hi>Yea, they ſpake againſt God: they ſaid, Can God furniſh a</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 19. 20.</note> 
               <hi>table in the wilderneſs? Behold he ſmote the rock, that the waters guſhed out, and the ſtreams overflowed, Can he give bread alſo? can he provide fleſh for his people?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 Temptations to <hi>ſin;</hi> to <hi>ſave</hi> and <hi>ſhift</hi> for your ſelves by ſin: As <hi>Abraham</hi> was tempted to <hi>lye,</hi> and ſaid that <hi>Sarah</hi> was not his wife, but his <hi>ſiſter: Peter</hi> to ſave <hi>himſelf,</hi> was tempted to <hi>deny Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the third place—Satan tempts after Converſion.</p>
            <p>1. He tempts new converts by <hi>pride. Young Chriſtians</hi> that are <hi>newly born,</hi> are ſubject to this ſin. For,</p>
            <p>1. They are come (as it were) into a <hi>new world,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know not what ground they ſtand on: And as a child that hath a new garment, the firſt day he wears it, or for a little while, as long as it is new, he is ſo proud, that he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſhow it, and will go abroad to ſhow his new cloathes; ſo the Saints at their firſt Converſion, when they have put on the <hi>new man,</hi> as long as it ſeems new, are very <hi>proud</hi> of it, and very <hi>fine</hi> in their own eye, and delight to ſhow abroad their <hi>graces,</hi> and will go in company to ſhow their <hi>new gifts</hi> and cloathes, none ſo forward to <hi>ſpeak</hi> or <hi>cenſure</hi> as they.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Diſciples</hi> were at firſt very <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 27.</note> for their leaving all for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as you may read; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we have forſaken all, and followed thee, what ſhall we have therefore?</hi> That is, <hi>we</hi> have done that which <hi>this young man</hi> would not.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>little</hi> grace (in a <hi>new convert</hi>) ſeems <hi>great;</hi> a little grace in a new convert ſeems great, and a great deal of grace in an old convert ſeems little: I ſay, a little grace in a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ſeems great.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe being but <hi>newly,</hi> and but <hi>ſmally</hi> enlightned, he doth not ſee all the <hi>dimenſions</hi> of grace: he doth not yet ſee
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55699:95"/> what <hi>quantity</hi> is in grace, what an <hi>abundance</hi> of grace is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſuch and ſuch <hi>duties,</hi> ſuch and ſuch <hi>temptations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Again, a <hi>little</hi> ſeems a <hi>great deal</hi> to him that had lately <hi>none.</hi> As <hi>two-pence</hi> or a <hi>groat</hi> is a great deal in a poor mans purſe, that had not ſo much there he knew not when: And a man that hath not a <hi>foot</hi> of land left him by his Father in the world, and lives thereafter very <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>needy;</hi> if an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nckle</hi> or <hi>Kinſman</hi> ſhould dye, and leave him but <hi>ten pound lands</hi> a year, he would count it a great deal (indeed, it is a great deal to nothing), and would count himſelf as <hi>good</hi> a man as he that hath his <hi>hundred</hi> a year.</p>
            <p>So a Saint that hath <hi>newly</hi> ſet up in the world, and was worth <hi>nothing</hi> a week a go, to him a <hi>little</hi> ſum of grace ſeems a great deal: and he (poor ſoul) is as <hi>brag</hi> and <hi>brisk</hi> of his <hi>little Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as he that hath his hundreds; and indeed a <hi>little grace</hi> is a <hi>great deal</hi> in reſpect of <hi>nothing:</hi> There's a vaſt difference between the <hi>leaſt entity</hi> and nothing: Contradiction (which is between <hi>ens</hi> and <hi>nonens</hi>) is the greateſt oppoſition: There is a far greater difference between <hi>little</hi> and <hi>nothing,</hi> than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>little</hi> and <hi>great:</hi> for there is <hi>ſome proportion</hi> between a <hi>little</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> but there is <hi>no proportion</hi> at all between <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> and <hi>little:</hi> between <hi>no</hi> being and <hi>little</hi> being: becauſe in that which is not, there is nothing to anſwer the Being of that which is, though it be never ſo little.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe a <hi>new unexperienced</hi> Convert thinks he can do a great deal with what he <hi>hath.</hi> As a man that's in health, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a log or a burden lying before him, thinks that he can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lift it till he comes to try: and a <hi>young ſpark</hi> that feels ſome blood in his veins, and vigour in his ſinews, thinks that he is able to <hi>beat</hi> or <hi>cope</hi> with a man of great ſtature.</p>
            <p>So a <hi>young Saint</hi> thinks that he is able to do <hi>great matters:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 20. 22.</note> When <hi>Chriſt</hi> asked the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Zebedee, Are ye able to drink of the cup that I ſhall drink of, and to be baptized with the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm that I am baptized with? They ſay unto him, we are able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Becauſe their graces are <hi>freſh,</hi> and <hi>lively,</hi> and <hi>active,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they think they are <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The <hi>young</hi> Convert is <hi>unexperienced:</hi> 1. He knows not what a great meaſure of <hi>grace</hi> is required to grapple with a little <hi>corruption:</hi> A ſin that is but little in compaſs, hath a great deal of weight in it: as a Bullet of Lead, that is but little in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55699:96"/> 
               <hi>circumference,</hi> yet weighs heavy and weighty.</p>
            <p>2. Satan tempts young Converts by laying <hi>burdens</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>1. To make the way of grace <hi>unpleaſant</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>2. By laying burdens on them greater than their <hi>graces,</hi> too heavy for their young graces to bear: Grace at the firſt birth is but <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>tender;</hi> a ſoul <hi>newly ſanctified,</hi> is like a glaſs, you know a <hi>fly</hi> may walk upon a glaſs; you have oftentimes ſeen a fly to go up and down, being a light body, whereas a great weight put upon it, would break it and ſhatter it all to pieces.</p>
            <p>So a <hi>light affliction</hi> may walk up and down upon a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert; but a <hi>heavy</hi> one would <hi>break</hi> him: Now Satan would lay <hi>heavy afflictions</hi> upon <hi>young Saints, great burdens</hi> upon <hi>little</hi> Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>2. He tempts the Saints (a while after their Converſion) to <hi>ſecurity, lukewarmneſs</hi> and <hi>worldlineſs.</hi> You ſeldom ſee a <hi>new convert</hi> troubled with theſe ſins: for then they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>upon</hi> the <hi>wing,</hi> they are <hi>newly awakened</hi> out of ſleep, and therefore (as a man that hath ſlept a long time, and is awakened) cannot ſuddenly fall aſleep again; ſo they having ſlept <hi>ſo long</hi> in the bed of nature, and being awakened, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in the <hi>morning</hi> of <hi>their converſion</hi> fall aſleep <hi>preſently</hi> again: and they <hi>mind</hi> not the world, they can do nothing but <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>meditate;</hi> for a while the buſineſs of <hi>the new life</hi> takes them up.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, Satan <hi>obſerves</hi> his time, and when they have <hi>been up,</hi> and ſpent a good part of the <hi>day,</hi> then he tempts them <hi>to take a nap,</hi> and after <hi>much exerciſe</hi> and <hi>glorious duties,</hi> they fall <hi>aſleep,</hi> and grow <hi>ſecure:</hi> Thus the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> he <hi>left his firſt love:</hi> And the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 4. Rev. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Laodicea,</hi> he became <hi>luke-warm,</hi> and was <hi>neither hot nor cold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Satan tempts them into <hi>ſin,</hi> to the <hi>worſt</hi> of ſins; that's Satans delight, to make the Saints ſin: as <hi>David</hi> to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
            <p>1. Satan brings a Saint into ſin, by making him confide in his <hi>habitual graces:</hi> as if his <hi>inward grace</hi> were enough to carry him out againſt a temptation; whereas, hadſt thou <hi>Adams grace</hi> (without <hi>effectual aſſiſtance</hi> from God) it could not
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55699:96"/> 
               <hi>uphold</hi> thee againſt one aſſault. Thus he brought <hi>Peter</hi> upon the ſtage, by making him <hi>preſume</hi> upon his inherent love to Chriſt, and ſo he fell and loſt the day.</p>
            <p>2. Satan brings a Saint into ſin, by making him confide in his <hi>former experiences:</hi> Becauſe he hath overcome <hi>ſuch</hi> a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and baffled <hi>ſuch</hi> a luſt, therefore he thinks he can do it <hi>again;</hi> or bear the ſhock of <hi>another</hi> temptation <hi>as ſtrong:</hi> But though <hi>former experience</hi> may be our <hi>comfort,</hi> yet it is not our <hi>preſent ſupport:</hi> Our <hi>ſtanding</hi> for the <hi>future,</hi> depends not on the <hi>former experience,</hi> but on <hi>renewing</hi> and <hi>corroborating</hi> grace from God.</p>
            <p>3. Satan tempts men into ſin, by repreſenting the <hi>world</hi> to them in <hi>glory:</hi> as Satan took Chriſt into an exceeding high<note place="margin">Matth 4. 8.</note> mountain, and ſhewed him all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the world, and the <hi>Glory</hi> of them: Satan can ſet a <hi>curious paint</hi> upon <hi>foul faces;</hi> he ſets a <hi>gloſs</hi> upon the world, and ſo men become <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>ſelf-ſeekers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. By blowing up <hi>old luſts</hi> to ſparkle afreſh: as fire almoſt out, may be blown into a flame: Like <hi>David,</hi> was blown up<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 22.</note> into a <hi>wild fire</hi> of Revenge, that none of <hi>Nabals</hi> houſe ſhould live.</p>
            <p>5. Satan tempts men into ſin, by perſwading them it is for <hi>God,</hi> by making you <hi>intend</hi> it for the <hi>Lord:</hi> Thus when <hi>Iſrael</hi> made the <hi>golden calf,</hi> and committed <hi>idolatry, Aaron made</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 5.</note> 
               <hi>proclamation, and ſaid, To morrow is a feaſt to the Lord,</hi> unto whom a feaſt ſhould have been kept; and <hi>to him</hi> they intended this their ſervice: ſee Satans depth! they commit <hi>idolatry,</hi> and pretend it for <hi>ſervice</hi> to the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Satan tempts to <hi>duty.</hi> You will think this a ſtrange phraſe, that Satan ſhould drive you to duty, to pray, or hear, and that I ſhould call <hi>doing duty,</hi> a <hi>temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Thus Satan tempted <hi>Saul</hi> to duty, to offer ſacrifice: he ſhould not have offered ſacrifice till <hi>Samuel</hi> came, and <hi>Satan</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 8, 9.</note> tempted him to offer ſacrifice before <hi>Samuel</hi> came: Satan will tempt us to <hi>duty,</hi> when it <hi>is not</hi> our duty: when <hi>duty</hi> is a <hi>ſin,</hi> he will tempt us to it: as ſometimes Satan tempts to <hi>prayer,</hi> when we ſhould not neglect our <hi>calling:</hi> ſometimes Satan tempts to faſting, when we ſhould not neglect our bodies.</p>
            <p>2. So he will tempt us to duty, ſo as to make duty a cloak for ſin: As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thought they might take liberty to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55699:97"/> ſin, as long as they ſerved <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>new moons,</hi> and <hi>ſabbaths,</hi> and <hi>ſacrifices:</hi> and thus it is with many amongſt us, they <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume</hi> the rather to <hi>ſin,</hi> becauſe they think to make <hi>amends</hi> for it afterwards by <hi>duty,</hi> or by ſome <hi>good deeds,</hi> as <hi>Prayer, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Alms, &amp;c.</hi> an horrible thing, to think that God will be thus corrupted, and made to wink at our ſin! But the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſervice</hi> will not excuſe the <hi>leaſt ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. He will tempt us to duty, when it is <hi>death</hi> to do the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Thus he tempts men to the <hi>ſacrament,</hi> when it is death to go to the Sacrament <hi>unſanctified,</hi> and <hi>unprepared:</hi> as he tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to long for fleſh, when it was <hi>death</hi> to long for it: <hi>While the fleſh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 11. 33.</note> 
               <hi>the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt the people, and the Lord ſmote the people with a very great plague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Satan tempts <hi>from</hi> duty, by plauſable reaſonings: Thus Satan tempts a ſoul to <hi>leave</hi> duty, and bid farewel to Prayer, and Sacraments, and Sermons: Why ſo? I am not the <hi>better</hi> by Prayer, nor Hearing, nor Reading, nay (methinks) I am far the <hi>worſe,</hi> and therefore I'le never hear more, nor attend Sacraments more, for my condemnation will be the <hi>greater:</hi> To this, I <hi>anſwer</hi> (and obſerve) arm your ſelf thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is better to periſh <hi>in</hi> duty, than <hi>out</hi> of duty. Whatever comes on thee, let God <hi>find</hi> thee doing <hi>his will;</hi> be the event what it will: Let death take thee praying, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; let death take thee waiting upon God for Faith and Grace: It is better for thee it ſhould be ſo, becauſe thou art doing thy Maſters will: And therefore ſay, I'le pray, and dye praying, though I be never heard; becauſe praying is my duty, and for Gods Glory: Let me <hi>dye</hi> in a duty that <hi>glorifieth</hi> him.</p>
            <p>2. Thou canſt never periſh <hi>in duties,</hi> if thou art found in them, in <hi>Obedience</hi> to God; thou mayſt be <hi>like</hi> to periſh in thy <hi>own ſenſe,</hi> but thou ſhalt never periſh, (I ſay) if thou art found in them, in Obedience to God: <hi>Obedience</hi> never went without <hi>ſucceſs:</hi> God will loſe <hi>himſelf</hi> as ſoon as he will let obedience loſe it ſelf: <hi>Duty may</hi> loſe a ſoul, but <hi>Obedience</hi> to God <hi>in duty;</hi> never yet loſt a ſoul to this day.</p>
            <p>3. It is but <hi>a may be,</hi> if thou periſh <hi>in</hi> duty, and in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: It is <hi>a ſhall be</hi> unto thee, to periſh <hi>out</hi> of duty; for <hi>duty</hi> is thy <hi>food,</hi> thou muſt <hi>live</hi> by duty: If a man eat food, it <hi>may be</hi> he <hi>may</hi> periſh, though he doth eat; but if he will not
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55699:97"/> take food at all, he <hi>ſhall</hi> periſh; ſo it may be, thou <hi>mayſt</hi> periſh in praying, and hearing, and receiving Sacraments, but thou <hi>ſhalt certainly</hi> periſh in the neglect of theſe.</p>
            <p>4. God will <hi>at laſt</hi> ſpeak to thee <hi>in</hi> duty, for it is <hi>his way,</hi> wherein he will be found: God ſpeaks not at firſt,</p>
            <p>1. To ſhew us the <hi>worth</hi> of the mercy. As when a man is <hi>hardly intreated</hi> to part with a thing, it is becauſe it is a thing of ſome value: a mean gift he will part with at the firſt word, or it may be without asking. So God gives <hi>mean things</hi> (as riches and honours in this life) to men <hi>without asking,</hi> to them that <hi>never</hi> call upon his name: But <hi>ſpiritual mercies,</hi> as peace of ſoul, joy and aſſurance of his love; theſe he doth not give <hi>ſuddenly</hi> and <hi>caſily,</hi> not becauſe he is <hi>hard</hi> to be intreated, (for he doth purpoſe to give them before we ask him), but to ſhew us the <hi>worth</hi> of thoſe rare and matchleſs mercies, of what value they are of.</p>
            <p>2. To <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> and <hi>breathe</hi> our faith. As wreſtling doth add ſtrength to arms and body; ſo praying, and praying again, doth ſtrengthen faith: as <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>exerciſe</hi> in running, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the <hi>lungs,</hi> and lengthens the breath; ſo by much praying, faith is <hi>well breathed: Jacob</hi> by wreſtling <hi>all night,</hi> is ſtronger to wreſtle in the <hi>morning:</hi> the Angel ſaid, <hi>Let me go, for the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 26.</note> 
               <hi>day breaketh: and he ſaid, I will not let thee go till thou bleſs me:</hi> He grew ſtronger and ſtronger, [<hi>I will not let thee go</hi>] he was ſtronger at laſt, than at the firſt.</p>
            <p>3. To keep us in the exerciſe of ſome <hi>other graces.</hi> He doth not at firſt give us <hi>aſſurance</hi> of his love, to keep us in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and longing after his loving-kindneſs: He doth not <hi>preſently</hi> (as ſoon as we ask him) Crown us with <hi>victory</hi> over a temptation, that he might keep us in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of <hi>humility</hi> and ſelf-loathing: he denieth us (for a while) ſome one comfort or grace for the exerciſe of another: <hi>For this thing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) I be ſought the Lord thrice, that it might</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>depart from me. And he ſaid unto me, My grace is ſufficient for thee: for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. To let us know that the <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>comfort</hi> we ask, is his <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> of <hi>free grace,</hi> not a <hi>debt</hi> unto our perſons, or our prayers: that when we have prayed never ſo long, yet he gives <hi>freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. To diſcipline us in <hi>humble obedience,</hi> and <hi>waiting</hi> on him;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55699:98"/> to teach us <hi>our place,</hi> that we may know <hi>our ſelves,</hi> that it is <hi>our duty</hi> to wait upon him as long as <hi>he pleaſes;</hi> and that we may <hi>underſtand</hi> his greatneſs and diſtance above us: God will keep up his place in the hearts of his people, and therefore will make them wait long before he gives in the things they pray for.</p>
            <p>Yet I ſay, for all this, <hi>God will at laſt ſpeak</hi> unto thee in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for it is his way wherein he will be found: He <hi>bids</hi> thee pray, therefore thou ſhalt <hi>ſpeed</hi> in Prayer: He <hi>bids</hi> thee hear, therefore thou ſhall <hi>meet</hi> him one time or other in hearing his word: When God ſeeth a Saint <hi>reſolves</hi> to pray for a mercy promiſed, as ſoon as ever he begins to pray for it, God <hi>reſolves</hi> to beſtow it, though he doth not <hi>manifeſt</hi> it to thee after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a prayer, that he will give it: See <hi>Dan. 9. 23, At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of thy ſupplications the Commandment came forth:</hi> that is, God hath revealed to us Angels, and to me eſpecially, the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> of his Counſel concerning the <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 65. 24.</note> and the <hi>Duration</hi> thereof, even to the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Sometimes (ſuch is Satans depth) a Saint doth <hi>ſin</hi> out of <hi>love</hi> to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> You would think this <hi>very ſtrange,</hi> yet it is <hi>very true:</hi> a Saint (I ſay) doth commit ſome ſins out of love to Chriſt. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> ſinned fearfully, when Chriſt told them <hi>that he muſt go to Jeruſalem, and ſuffer many things of the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 16. 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>elders, and chief prieſts, and ſcribes, and be killed: Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, ſaying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this ſhall not be unto thee: Peter took him,</hi> that is, took him by the hand, and led him aſide, as they uſe to do, who would <hi>talk familiarly</hi> with a friend; or <hi>took him,</hi> that is, <hi>embraced</hi> him; <hi>be it far from thee,</hi> that is, thou haſt deſerved no ſuch <hi>ſhameful death; this ſhall not be unto thee,</hi> that is, we will not ſuffer thee to go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be ſlain; or [let not this be]. <hi>Peter</hi> did all this out of his <hi>love</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt: yet Chriſt called him<note place="margin">Verſ. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So again, when <hi>Christ</hi> waſhed his Diſciples feet, <hi>Peter</hi> would<note place="margin">John 13 8.</note> not let Chriſt waſh his feet, <hi>Thou ſhalt never waſh my feet:</hi> This was out of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>reſpect</hi> to Chriſt: <hi>Peter</hi> thought Chriſt <hi>too good</hi> to waſh <hi>his feet,</hi> and therefore put him off: But it was a <hi>great ſin,</hi> inſomuch that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou hast no part in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So again, when the <hi>Samaritans</hi> would not receive Chriſt, his<note place="margin">Luk. 9. 54.</note>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:55699:98"/> Diſciples <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and conſume them, even as Elias did?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>7thly,</hi> Satan tempts to <hi>extreams.</hi> Satan will not have you do a thing in ſeaſon; and when it is <hi>too late,</hi> then he will make you mad upon doing of it: Thus he would not let the <hi>children of Iſrael</hi> go into <hi>Canaan,</hi> when they had the gate of ſeaſon <hi>open,</hi> and when they had Gods <hi>good will</hi> to go in: But when 'twas <hi>too late,</hi> when 'twas a <hi>ſin</hi> to deſire to go, when God had <hi>ſhut</hi> the gate of opportunity, and ſet a <hi>lock</hi> of prohibition on it; as you know when you walk or travel, you ſhall find gates, not only ſhut, but a lock alſo put upon them for ſecurity; and then you conjecture, that not only you <hi>cannot,</hi> but you <hi>muſt not</hi> go through ſuch a place or piece of ground: or where there was a ſtile to go over a mans land, when you come again, and find the ſtile taken up, and a hedg made; you conclude that now it is not the owners pleaſure that any paſſengers ſhould make a thorow-fare there any more.</p>
            <p>So it was with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God offered them, and made a ſtile for them to ſtep over into <hi>Canaan: The Lord thy God hath ſet the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>land before thee, go up, and poſſeſs it,</hi> and then they would not; for they ſent <hi>ſpies to ſearch</hi> the land, and upon their report <hi>wept</hi> and <hi>murmured,</hi> and wiſht, <hi>Would God we had dyed in this</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 14. 2.</note>

If Satan be ſo <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>exquiſite</hi> an Artiſt in the Trade of <hi>deceiving</hi> ſouls, then humble your ſelves in that you are ſo <hi>capable</hi> and <hi>receptive</hi> of Satans motions: He is a willing <hi>agent,</hi> ſo we are willing <hi>patients:</hi> we are wont to ſay, that the <hi>receiver</hi> is as bad as the <hi>thief,</hi> and the <hi>harlot</hi> that entertains the motion, is as bad as the <hi>adulterer:</hi> So (my Beloved) when <hi>Satan</hi> tempts, and <hi>you</hi> ſin, <hi>you</hi> are as bad as the <hi>tempter;</hi> you are his <hi>Harlots,</hi> that conſent to his <hi>adulterous</hi> motions: thy conſent to his temptation makes thee one with him: What makes <hi>two</hi> perſons at any time <hi>one? Conſent.</hi> Thus <hi>conſent</hi> makes two perſons one in <hi>marriage,</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> makes two perſons one in a <hi>Deſign</hi> or <hi>Action:</hi> ſo thy conſent with Satan, makes thee one with Satan, and as bad as he is.</p>
            <p>If an adulterer ſhould tempt a mans wife to lewdneſs, though he would <hi>hate</hi> the Adulterer, yet he would lay the <hi>greateſt blame</hi> upon his wife, and take it moſt unkindly from her, and break
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55699:99"/> his heart with grief, that ſhe (whom he loved ſo well) ſhould deal ſo ill with him? So when Satan (that great Adulterer) tempts thee to ſin, though Chriſt <hi>hates</hi> him for it, and will at laſt be <hi>revenged</hi> on him (for <hi>jealouſie is the rage of a man:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 6. 34.</note> 
               <hi>therefore he will not ſpare in the day of vengeance</hi>), yet he takes it moſt unkindly at <hi>thee,</hi> that <hi>thou Saint,</hi> whom he loved <hi>ſo well;</hi> that <hi>thou ſinner,</hi> for whom he <hi>ſhed his blood;</hi> that <hi>thou profeſſor,</hi> who art his <hi>bride,</hi> ſhould hearken to ſuch a <hi>baſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> as <hi>Satan</hi> is.</p>
            <p>And therefore do not put your ſins <hi>off from your ſelves</hi> to <hi>Satan;</hi> do not think that becauſe <hi>he tempts</hi> you, <hi>you</hi> ſhall not <hi>anſwer</hi> for them: I will give you two noted Inſtances to the contrary. The firſt is <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve: Eve</hi> was tempted by<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 3. 1 Tim. 2. 14. 1 Chr. 21. 1.</note> the <hi>Serpent,</hi> (and mark ye, ſhe was deceived and beguiled by him), and yet ſee how God curſeth <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> for that ſin, and <hi>entails</hi> curſes to all their poſterity for it. The ſecond Inſtance is that of <hi>David,</hi> who was tempted by Satan to <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the people.</hi> Now to diſcover our vileneſs, note theſe two things:</p>
            <p>1. Satan cannot <hi>compel</hi> us to ſin, only <hi>perſwade</hi> us; he hath only a <hi>perſwading ſlight,</hi> not an <hi>enforcing might:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>James</hi> tells you, that <hi>every man when he is tempted, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and drawn away of his own luſt:</hi> Though <hi>Satan</hi> hath a hand (and that no ſmall one) in tempting of us; yet, becauſe he doth only <hi>allure</hi> us, and lay baits for us, but not <hi>conſtrain</hi> us, becauſe he cannot <hi>make</hi> us ſin <hi>againſt our wills,</hi> becauſe our <hi>own luſt</hi> carrieth the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> ſtroke; therefore he ſaith, <hi>Every man is tempted and drawn away,</hi> not by the <hi>Devil,</hi> but <hi>by his own luſt:</hi> for Satan can do nothing but by our own luſts.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe in obeying <hi>Satans Temptations,</hi> we do our <hi>own wills:</hi> We do not ſin to <hi>ſerve Satan,</hi> but to <hi>pleaſe</hi> our ſelves:<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2, 3.</note> As wicked men in doing <hi>Gods work,</hi> aim at <hi>themſelves;</hi> ſo in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Satans work,</hi> we do it to <hi>ſerve</hi> our own ſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is <hi>our</hi> ſin.</p>

            <p>Know (my Beloved) that God loves us, as well when he doth us <hi>evil,</hi> as when he doth us <hi>good</hi> in this world: <hi>Satan</hi> will go about to perſwade thee <hi>in afflictions</hi> (as thou muſt look for them) that God <hi>hates</hi> thee, and <hi>cares</hi> not for thee: if he <hi>loved</hi> thee, he would not uſe thee <hi>thus</hi> as he doth: Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, make God <hi>thine,</hi> and then be cheerful <hi>in every ſtate:</hi> It becomes a gracious man to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in afflictions, in ſickneſs, in poverty, in weakneſs, in reproach, in perſecution: <hi>Satan</hi> in all afflictions would <hi>befool</hi> thee, and make thee believe any thing, as if thou wert no body with God, becauſe thou art ſick, or poor, and no body in the world; it is his <hi>delight</hi> to fill thee with <hi>ſorrow:</hi> But I ſay, it becomes a gracious man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in afflictions.</p>

And again, <hi>As ſorrowful, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way rejoycing,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 10. The <hi>ſorrow</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhould be like the <hi>joy</hi> of the <hi>wicked, only in appearance: Paul</hi> had only a <hi>ſhadow</hi> of ſorrow [<hi>as ſorrowful</hi>], but his <hi>joy</hi> was <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> and <hi>lasting, [always rejoycing</hi>] though his <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate</hi> caſt up, amounted but to this [<hi>poor and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing</hi>], yet he was always rejoycing: Why ſo?</p>
            <p>Becauſe <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>ſame</hi> in all varieties: God loves us, as well when we are poor, as when we are rich; as well when himſelf ſmites, as when he heals: he is as <hi>good</hi> to us when we <hi>receive evil,</hi> as when we <hi>receive good:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>God</hi> be the <hi>ſame,</hi> ſurely <hi>we</hi> ought to be the <hi>ſame</hi> too, and our <hi>faith</hi> the <hi>ſame: Now</hi> thou mourneſt, <hi>heretofore</hi> thou didſt rejoyce; <hi>now</hi> (it may be) thou art in want, but thou <hi>hast had</hi> abundance, and therefore thou art dejected and ſad, and canſt ſcarce lead one comfortable day for diſquiets and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in thy thoughts: We have a ſaying, [<hi>Faelicem fuiſſe, miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimum</hi>]; it is a miſerable thing to have been happy: But 'tis
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55699:100"/> vain; a godly man is <hi>happy</hi> in the midſt of all his <hi>miſery:</hi> he may ſay with <hi>Luther, Let him be miſerable that can be miſerable, I cannot:</hi> He that hath not a God to loſe, nor a ſoul to loſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be miſerable, whatſoever he loſes: while <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>ſafe,</hi> a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi> hath no reaſon to be <hi>unſatisfied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this will diſcover the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> to you, your joy in God: When we have <hi>outward mercies,</hi> we think we rejoyce in them, only <hi>as pledges</hi> of Gods love, when indeed we rejoyce more in the <hi>benefits</hi> themſelves, than in the <hi>benefactor:</hi> The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is, by our <hi>drooping</hi> and <hi>dejection</hi> under the Croſs: If it had been Gods favour <hi>only</hi> we had rejoyced in in our proſperity, why then is the copy of our countenance changed? for Gods favour is ſtill the <hi>ſame</hi> to <hi>his</hi> in affliction, as it is in proſperity; haply <hi>greater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So again, obſerve thy ſelf in a ſickneſs, thou wilt ſay, oh I am hindred from doing <hi>God</hi> ſervice by ſickneſs, as if thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt health <hi>meerly</hi> to do God ſervice: this is thy hearts deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: Satan would make thee believe that thou deſireſt health to do God ſervice, when it is out of love to health it ſelf: For,</p>
            <p>1. Every ſtate that <hi>God</hi> puts us into, is the <hi>best ſervice</hi> to him. When God puts us into ſickneſs to ſerve him, there is the beſt ſervice: A maſter takes <hi>that</hi> ſervice beſt from a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants hands, which he commands him to do; ſo if God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thee to be ſick, and commands thee to ſerve him on a ſick bed, this is the <hi>best ſervice;</hi> thy maſter would have thee employed there.</p>
            <p>2. God <hi>may,</hi> yea <hi>hath</hi> as <hi>much uſe</hi> of our lives in our <hi>troubles,</hi> as in our <hi>comforts.</hi> We may do much buſineſs for God on a <hi>ſick bed:</hi> we may do God as much work when we are <hi>bound hand</hi> and <hi>foot</hi> in a priſon, as when we are at <hi>liberty: Paſſive obedience</hi> brings as much glory to God, as <hi>active</hi> doth: Afflictions are the higheſt ſervices and employments of grace. Oh! but my graces are <hi>weak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. God will put <hi>weak grace</hi> to no more work than it <hi>can</hi> do:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able: but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it. He ſhall feed his flock like</hi>

            </p>
            <p>2. God will raiſe up <hi>little grace</hi> (ſometimes) to act <hi>above</hi> its ſtrength: though the <hi>babe</hi> be but weak, the <hi>nurſe</hi> is ſtrong; ſo, though <hi>grace</hi> be weak, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is ſtrong: <hi>And he ſaid</hi>

            <p>Well then, to return to my Text, <hi>God tempted Abraham after theſe things,</hi> that is, thoſe things that went before; but how long this was after, it appears not by the Text, ſave only, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was then of ſufficient age and ſtrength to carry a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of wood for ſacrifice, being then (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith) five<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>After theſe things God tempted Abraham,</hi> after all the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding paſſages of his life, more particularly, after <hi>ſo many</hi> and <hi>ſo great</hi> promiſes made to him by God, concerning the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his ſeed by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or after <hi>ſo many</hi> temptations he had paſſed through already; God brings up this in the Reer, and tempts him again.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> (as <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> relates) ſay, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was tempted ten times by God.</p>

               <hi>experimentum ſumit de eo, de quo eſt certus</hi>], no man makes a tryal of him, of whom he is certain, what or who he is, or what he can do.</p>
            <p>The end of tryal is to <hi>know,</hi> I ſay, we therefore <hi>try,</hi> another,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55699:104"/> that we may <hi>inform</hi> our knowledg: and therefore all <hi>proper temptation</hi> ſprings from <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>doubting.</hi> When we <hi>try</hi> a man by ſome experience, whether he loves us or no, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we <hi>know not,</hi> but <hi>would</hi> know whether he loves us: when we are <hi>aſſured</hi> of his love to us, we <hi>try</hi> him no longer.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay then, How could</hi> God <hi>try</hi> Abraham? <hi>Did not</hi> God <hi>who made the heart,</hi> know <hi>the heart of</hi> Abraham? <hi>Did not God who knows</hi> all things, <hi>know that</hi> Abraham <hi>feared God? Certainly God who knows the thoughts</hi> a-far of, <hi>knew</hi> Abraham, <hi>and all that was in</hi> Abraham, <hi>and what</hi> Abraham <hi>would do; he</hi> knew <hi>before-hand</hi> Abrahams <hi>affections to him, and therefore how is it ſaid, that</hi> God tempted Abraham?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a two-fold <hi>tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A <hi>proper:</hi> And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A <hi>metaphorical</hi> tryal.</p>
            <p>1. To try properly, is [<hi>actio neſcientis</hi>] an action of him who knows not the heart, of him whom he trys and tempts; for (as you heard) he trys that he may know: [<hi>Tentatio propria eſt latentis animi alicujus exploratio</hi>], A <hi>proper</hi> tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the <hi>trying</hi> of a mans mind or diſpoſition that lyeth <hi>latent</hi> and out of our ſight: We <hi>know not</hi> what is in him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we <hi>try</hi> him: And thus God tempted not, tryed not <hi>Abraham:</hi> he needed not this tryal, that he might know <hi>Abraham:</hi> Neither did <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſacrificing his Son add any thing to Gods Knowledg. But,</p>
            <p>2. There is a <hi>metaphorical</hi> tryal, or a temptation by <hi>ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> doth a thing like unto thoſe, who <hi>try</hi> that they <hi>may know; men</hi> make tryal, that they may <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> acted in this thing <hi>like</hi> to men: and therefore he is ſaid to <hi>tempt</hi> or <hi>try Abraham,</hi> though he knew all before he tryed him. I conclude with that excellent expreſſion of <hi>Caſſiodorus, [Tentat Deus ut erudiat, homo ut ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>So then God tempted <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, he commanded that work whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>tempted</hi> or <hi>tryed,</hi> but he did not try or tempt <hi>Abraham</hi> to gain any <hi>further</hi> Knowledg to himſelf.</p>

            <p>Object. <hi>But you will ſay, It ſeems the contrary: for when</hi> Abraham <hi>would have really ſlain his ſon Iſaac, ſaith God,</hi> Now I know that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held thy Son, thine only Son from me.</p>

               <hi>man</hi> is ſaid to tempt God. But we read not in Scripture, that the <hi>good angels,</hi> or <hi>devils</hi> are tempted. The reaſon whereof may without abſurdity be enquired (if it can be found out) becauſe they are alſo <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and it is the <hi>rational nature</hi> that is ſubject to Temptation: And the reaſon ſeems to be this, becauſe</p>
            <p>The <hi>holy angels,</hi> ſuch is their condition, that they <hi>indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubly adhere</hi> to God: the <hi>evil angels,</hi> or <hi>devils,</hi> ſuch is their condition, that they <hi>immutably</hi> adhere to evil: and therefore Temptation here hath no place.</p>
            <p>But now it is otherwiſe with <hi>man:</hi> his condition is <hi>mutable,</hi> and his ſtate is a ſtate of Temptation; he hath yet <hi>heaven</hi> to loſe, and <hi>hell</hi> to fall into; if he takes not care; as long as he is in this life, he is in the way of <hi>winning</hi> or <hi>loſing,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here he is upon the ſtage of Temptation.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Devils</hi> are in their <hi>center,</hi> out of which they <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> be moved: The devils <hi>cannot</hi> be changed, and the holy angels <hi>cannot</hi> be altered.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But upon this account (you will ſay) there is no ground at all why</hi> God <hi>ſhould be tempted, for he is</hi> unchangeable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. God</hi> in himſelf is ſuch, that he cannot be tempted; yet by the <hi>ignorance</hi> of man, it comes to paſs that God is tempted.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, in Scripture you ſhall find that,</p>
            <p>1. God is ſaid to tempt man. And,</p>
            <p>2. Man is ſaid to tempt God.</p>
            <pb n="205" facs="tcp:55699:106"/>
            <p>1. <hi>Man</hi> is ſaid to <hi>tempt God;</hi> and this is, when a man makes a tryal of <hi>God,</hi> whether he be <hi>wiſe,</hi> or <hi>powerful, just,</hi> or <hi>true</hi> and <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>tempt</hi> or <hi>try God,</hi> may be ſometimes <hi>good,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Sometimes there is a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>lawful tryal</hi> and <hi>tempting</hi> of God: When we humbly and ſubmiſſively put him to do ſomething to confirm our faith. Thus <hi>Gideon</hi> tried and proved<note place="margin">Judg. 6. 37, 38, 39, 40.</note> the Lord: <hi>Gideon tempted</hi> or <hi>proved</hi> God, but 'twas accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, becauſe he did it ſimply with an humble heart. But,</p>
            <p>2. To tempt God, is for the moſt part taken in an <hi>ill</hi> ſenſe: I ſay, there is a <hi>ſinful</hi> tempting of God, and it ariſeth either out of <hi>diſtruſt,</hi> or <hi>impatience,</hi> or <hi>raſh preſumption,</hi> or <hi>pride,</hi> or too much <hi>confidence:</hi> of this you may read in <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 2, 7, When the people wanted water, 'tis ſaid, <hi>They did chide with Moſes:</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Why chide you with me? Wherefore do you tempt the Lord?</hi> At the ſeventh verſe, <hi>And he called the name of the place Maſſah and Meribah, becauſe of the chiding of the children of Iſrael, and becauſe they tempted the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>God</hi> is ſaid in Scripture to <hi>tempt man:</hi> which is the <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs</hi> of my Text, and the <hi>ſubject</hi> of this preſent Diſcourſe: And herein I ſhall (God willing) ſhew you four things:</p>
            <p>1. That God doth <hi>tempt</hi> man.</p>
            <p>2. It ſtands with <hi>Gods Holineſs</hi> to tempt man, his Holineſs and Righteouſneſs to tempt man.</p>
            <p>3. Why God tempts man.</p>
            <p>4. How God doth tempt man.</p>
            <p>1. God he doth tempt man: he doth <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>try</hi> men. He makes experience, and tryeth what they are, and what is in them: When the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to <hi>Marah,</hi> the<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 25.</note> waters were <hi>bitter, and the people murmured, ſaying, What ſhall we drink? And God ſhewed Moſes a tree, which when he had caſt into the waters, the waters were made ſweet; and</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>there he proved them.</hi> So in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 4, they <hi>murmur</hi> for want of bread, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you: and the people ſhall go out, and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.</hi> God <hi>tempts</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:55699:107"/> his people, and it is to <hi>try</hi> them and <hi>prove</hi> them, whether they will ſerve him, and his deſigns. And in <hi>Deut. 8. 2, Thou ſhalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee theſe forty years in the wilderneſs, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldſt keep his Commandments, or no.</hi> So that to prove, is no more than to tempt, and to tempt is no more than to prove: God led <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> through the wilderneſs, through many difficulties, it was to <hi>prove</hi> and <hi>tempt</hi> them to <hi>know</hi> what was in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But it is ſaid in</hi> James 1. 13, 14, <hi>that</hi> God <hi>tempts no man;</hi> Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: But every man when he is tempted, is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed. <hi>Here it is ſaid, that</hi> God tempts not any man, <hi>yet it is ſaid in my Text,</hi> That God tempted Abraham: <hi>How can theſe ſtand together?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a two-fold way of Temptation.</p>
            <p>1. There is <hi>Tentatio probationis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There is <hi>Tentatio ſeductionis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. There is a tempting by way of <hi>Tryal</hi> or <hi>Probation:</hi> and thus God (as ye heard) tempted <hi>Abraham</hi> to try his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and he tempts his people to <hi>prove</hi> their graces; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them with Trials, that their graces may be known, or their pride diſcovered, and brought low.</p>
            <p>There is a tempting by way of <hi>ſeducement:</hi> and thus is <hi>James</hi> to be underſtood, that <hi>God tempts not any man,</hi> that is, he <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth</hi> and <hi>enticeth</hi> no man to ſin: he ſuggeſts no <hi>evil,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilleth any <hi>impure</hi> thoughts, nor caſts any <hi>ſinful</hi> inſuſions into the heart: Thus, be ſure of it, God he tempteth not, either by <hi>inward ſolicitation,</hi> or by ſuch an <hi>outward diſpenſation,</hi> as may inforce to ſin; he that is the <hi>ultor</hi> or <hi>avenger</hi> of ſin, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the <hi>Author</hi> of ſin: Thus let his people look upon him, he <hi>trieth</hi> their obedience, but doth not ſtir them up to ſin.</p>
            <p>2. It ſtands with Gods <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>try</hi> his people. That you may underſtand this, you muſt know that,</p>
            <p>1. There are Temptations which are <hi>good.</hi> And</p>
            <pb n="207" facs="tcp:55699:107"/>
            <p>2. There are Temptations which are <hi>evil.</hi> Gods Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Tryals of men are <hi>very good;</hi> for as you heard, God <hi>cannot</hi> tempt to ſin; and our anſwer to that Text in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 13, would reſolve you here, and untie this knot: Yet for farther <hi>Dilucidation,</hi> I pray you underſtand, that to make a Temptation <hi>good,</hi> there are three things required.</p>
            <p>1. He that <hi>tempts</hi> or <hi>tries</hi> another, muſt have [<hi>jus tentandi</hi>] a <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> to do it.</p>
            <p>2. He muſt have a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>good end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Thirdly, He muſt tempt or try in a <hi>juſt way,</hi> or by <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He that tempts or tries another, muſt have <hi>jus tentandi,</hi> a juſt Right or Authority to do it: and this Right God hath to tempt and try men: For they are <hi>his creatures, and the work of his hands:</hi> He hath a glorious <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> over Angels and Men which he made: Have not <hi>parents</hi> a power to try the Obedience of their Children, ſo the means they uſe be <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>lawful?</hi> May not a <hi>General</hi> try the Valour and skill of his Soldiers? and do not you try and prove the ſwiftneſs of your horſe? Nay, may not a mam (a juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure being obſerved) try his own ſtrength?</p>
            <p>Seeing then God is the <hi>ſupream Rector</hi> and Governour of the World, ſurely he hath an <hi>undoubted Right</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to tempt and try the <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> of men, and the <hi>virtue</hi> of his Saints.</p>
            <p>2. To make a temptation good, he that tempts or tries, muſt have a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>good end:</hi> and this leads us to the</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Point, why</hi> God tempts and tries his people: and that is <hi>three-fold,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. His own <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To manifeſt the <hi>vertues</hi> of his people.</p>
            <p>3. To manifeſt and draw out their <hi>infirmities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. One end why God tempts and tries his Saints, is to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and diſcover their graces, virtues, and perfections; and this was one reaſon why God tempted <hi>Abraham;</hi> God tryed <hi>Abraham,</hi> that it may be <hi>known</hi> that he feared God: Did not <hi>God</hi> know it before? Yes: but, Sirs, God ſpeaks after the manner of men; he deals with man, after the manner of men: God knew <hi>Abraham</hi> loved him, and feared him, but God ſpeaks to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a man, <hi>Now I know that thou fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55699:108"/> me, and lovest me:</hi> God will have the graces, vertues, and perfections of his Saints <hi>manifeſted</hi> and <hi>diſcovered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another end why God tempts and tries his people, is to <hi>diſcover</hi> and <hi>draw out</hi> their infirmities: [<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t latens creaturae vitium patefiat</hi>], that ſome <hi>latent vice</hi> or <hi>ſin</hi> of the Creature may be made <hi>manifeſt:</hi> Thus the Text ſaith concerning <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chr. 32. 31.</note> 
               <hi>That in the buſineſs of the embaſſadors of the princes of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, who ſent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sirs, <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> God had appeared in doing great wonders for him; when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> came with a great Army againſt him, the Lord ſent an <hi>Angel</hi> which cut off all the mighty men of Valour, and the Leaders and Captains in the Camp of the King of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> then there came <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> from the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> to Honour and Court <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> becauſe God had done ſo much for him: By this tranſaction <hi>Hezekiah</hi> grew proud, and God let him alone, and left him, to <hi>try</hi> him: It is one of Gods glorious works to tempt a <hi>proud</hi> man, and leave him to himſelf. Obſerve the difference between the ſecond temptation: Firſt when he tempts a man to diſcover his graces, this is from God himſelf; but when God tempts to diſcover ſin, it is the cauſe of him who is tempted, and not in God who tempts him.</p>
            <p>3. The third <hi>end</hi> why God tempts his people, is for his <hi>glory. Job</hi> was tempted moſt ſadly; and though the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was <hi>executed</hi> by <hi>Satan,</hi> yet it was <hi>inſtituted</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi> by Gods Ordination.</p>
            <p>God had owned <hi>Job</hi> for his ſervant, and his <hi>brave</hi> ſervant too, for <hi>an upright man, one that feared God, and eſchewed evil:</hi> Have you <hi>ſo good</hi> and <hi>high</hi> an opinion of him, ſaith <hi>Satan?</hi> do but <hi>touch</hi> his eſtate, and his body, <hi>and he will curſe thee to thy face:</hi> ſayſt thou ſo, ſaith <hi>God? tempt</hi> him, ſaith God, and <hi>try</hi> him to the uttermoſt, I will give thee a Warrant and Commiſſion to do it: Satan ſets upon him, as far as God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his Commiſſion: and <hi>Job</hi> was grievouſly afflicted, yet found upright in the main, ſteel to the back, and made Gods word good: How did God gain glory over Satan here? Glory to his <hi>truth:</hi> what God had ſaid of <hi>Jobs</hi> commendation, <hi>Job</hi> veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Glory to his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> that he kept <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:55699:108"/> ſervants: Glory to his <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>all-ſufficiency,</hi> that his ſervants will not part with him for any other maſter; let their afflictions and hardſhips in his ſervice, be what they will; they will not change their God, he is a better Lord and Maſter with <hi>afflictions,</hi> than the World is or can be with all ſugar'd-ſops of <hi>honour</hi> or <hi>proſperity:</hi> his ſervice is worth all their afflictions and ſorrows in it; that poverty with <hi>God,</hi> is better than riches, and reproaches with <hi>God</hi> are better than honours: How is Gods worth and glory <hi>magnified</hi> here by <hi>Jobs</hi> Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
            <p>2. God gains Glory from his Saints themſelves, I ſay, his <hi>tempted</hi> Saints: They will afterwards admire, and adore, and thank, and praiſe him, that his Soveraignty would make uſe of <hi>them</hi> unworthly wretches, for his ſervice, and honour <hi>them</hi> with any employment for him: that his <hi>free grace</hi> would give <hi>them</hi> grace to engage for <hi>him,</hi> rather than <hi>ſin:</hi> that his power would bear them up with ſtrength under their trials and temptations, for they aſcribe all, both <hi>Combat</hi> and <hi>Victory,</hi> to his power, ſaying, <hi>Who was ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> that <hi>his power</hi> ſhould be made perfect in <hi>their weakneſs;</hi> that he ſhould by <hi>weak inſtruments</hi> do ſuch great things; preſerve <hi>ſmall ſparks</hi> of fire in ſo great a <hi>Sea</hi> of trials, and keep weak candles alive in the face of ſuch <hi>ſtrong winds</hi> and aſſaults; that God by ſuch <hi>poor twigs</hi> as they are, ſhould beat the <hi>old great ſerpent:</hi> Oh, this makes much for the praiſe of his <hi>power,</hi> that his mercy ſhould watch over them in their temptations, and turn all to their good, refine them from their droſs, <hi>accept</hi> what was <hi>good</hi> in them, and <hi>pardon</hi> what is <hi>evil,</hi> and at laſt <hi>deliver</hi> them out of all; I tell you, when God ſhall appear, he will be <hi>glorified</hi> and <hi>admired</hi> in all his Saints for theſe things, even for their <hi>trials</hi> and <hi>temptations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If the Saints do <hi>stumble</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> when they are tried by God, yet it makes for his glory: What makes for their <hi>good,</hi> makes for his <hi>glory,</hi> when by their fall ſome <hi>ſecret</hi> ſin is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as pride or ſelf-confidence; their <hi>latent</hi> diſpoſitions are made known, and their <hi>hearts</hi> are expoſed to their view; doth not this make to the glory of his <hi>wiſdom?</hi> When their ſin is cured by <hi>ſinning,</hi> doth not he appear a moſt skilful phyſitian? When being wounded by their <hi>fall,</hi> they are <hi>healed</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,</hi> doth not this make to the glory of his <hi>mercy?</hi> Do they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55699:109"/> not cry out, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneſt iniqnity?</hi> When they riſe again out of ſin, and grow more ſtrong by their falls; when <hi>they</hi> are raiſed, where <hi>others</hi> break their necks, doth it not make to the glory of his <hi>power?</hi> So that every way, Gods trials and temptations make for his glory; they make for their good, and therefore for his glory: God tempts the godly and the ungodly, he doth it for his glory: By <hi>Abrahams</hi> temptation his <hi>faith</hi> was brought to light; by <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> temptation, his <hi>pride</hi> was detected.</p>
            <p>And therefore the temptation whereby God tries man, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be good, and always good, as it proceeds from God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſometimes man abuſeth it to his hurt; for (as we ſaid) God tempts both the <hi>godly</hi> and the <hi>ungodly,</hi> and the event in both is ſometime <hi>good,</hi> and ſometime <hi>bad;</hi> as men are either <hi>confirm'd</hi> by the grace of God, or being deſtitute of it, are left to themſelves; although God always makes the event [other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bad enough] to turn at laſt to the <hi>godly</hi> to their good, that by their <hi>falls</hi> coming to ſee and acknowledg their <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>infirmity,</hi> they may with ſo much more diligence (through Gods grace) work out their ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
            <p>And thus (as we hinted before) by <hi>Abrahams</hi> temptation, his glorious faith was tried and brought forth to light: By <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi> temptation, his vanity and weakneſs was detected, that ſo he might walk afterwards with more caution and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>3. To make a temptation good, he that tries, muſt do it in a <hi>juſt way,</hi> by <hi>good</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> means: for we <hi>muſt</hi> not do evil, that good may come: and God <hi>will</hi> not do evil, that good may come of it; nay God is ſo holy, that he <hi>cannot</hi> do evil that good may come of it.</p>
            <p>And this leads us to the fourth point:</p>
            <p>4. How God doth tempt and try: and here I muſt tell you, that God doth tempt and try men two manner of ways:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Immediately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Mediately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately, By <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mediately, By <hi>inſtruments,</hi> by <hi>Satan,</hi> ſometimes; by <hi>wicked</hi> men other times; but always <hi>juſtly.</hi> How doth God try and tempt his people?</p>
            <pb n="301" facs="tcp:55699:109"/>
            <p>1. He tries and tempts his people by giving them <hi>Commands.</hi> We try our children by giving them ſomething to do: ſome ſpecial command to obey: God tempts his Children by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them ſometimes ſuch things as are <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>offenſive</hi> to nature, ungrateful and diſpleaſing to the fleſh, abſurd to reaſon: Thus he tempted <hi>Abraham</hi> in my Text, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he commanded him to ſacrifice his Son, his only <hi>Iſaac:</hi> Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded the <hi>young man</hi> to go and ſell all, and follow him: Unhappy man! that had the command, but had no love to obey the command: For when he heard ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>he went away ſorrowful, for he had great poſſeſſions.</hi>

            <p>Sirs, This is the caſe of many of you, Gods Commands are your tryals, and God commands you to repent and leave ſin preſently; and you go away ſorrowful: God commands you to part with your <hi>beloved</hi> ſin, your <hi>ſweet</hi> or <hi>profitable</hi> ſin, and you go away ſorrowful.</p>
            <p>2. God tempts by <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>perſecutions,</hi> and theſe are great Temptations, and make the heart heavy: there is <hi>ſpiritual</hi> joy and <hi>outward</hi> heavineſs at the ſame time; <hi>wherein</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>ye greatly rejoyce, though now for a ſeaſon ye are in heavineſs through manifold temptations;</hi> that is, <hi>afflictions;</hi> their <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in Chriſt made them <hi>rejoyce,</hi> their <hi>temptations</hi> at the ſame time made them <hi>heavy:</hi> here was <hi>ſowre</hi> and <hi>ſweet, gladneſs</hi> and <hi>heavineſs</hi> (like the <hi>twilight</hi>) at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> in the <hi>ſame ſubject</hi> together.</p>
            <p>Sirs, ſirs, God will tempt <hi>his;</hi> if you be his, God will tempt <hi>you</hi> with afflictions, he will make <hi>you</hi> know what metal you are of, and therefore will one time or other throw you into the furnace.</p>
            <p>3. God tempts and tries his people by the <hi>proſperity</hi> of the <hi>wicked,</hi> and this to weak nature is a ſore affliction; when their <hi>own</hi> affliction, and <hi>ſinners</hi> proſperity face one another, they ſee <hi>themſelves</hi> in poverty, and <hi>Gods Enemies</hi> wealthy; they ſee themſelves <hi>peſtered</hi> with ſickneſs, and ſinners <hi>frolick</hi> in their health and jollity; their own bones withered, and the bones of the ungodly full of marrow; Oh! ſometimes, it is a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as keen as a Razor, <hi>Verily, I have cleanſed my heart in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 13. 14.</note>

            </p>
            <p>4. God tempts by <hi>mercies,</hi> by giving men mercies, talents and opportunities, to ſee what they will do with them, and how they will improve them: And thus God hath tempted you <hi>kindly,</hi> and tried you <hi>ſweetly</hi> a long time with Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, and Goſpel-days; oh the golden ſeaſons of <hi>grace</hi> that have for many years dropt upon you! Oh the melting dews of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and refeſhing ſhowres of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> that have daily wet you! ſo that you have been as a <hi>water'd gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and God hath been trying you with theſe all this while: and where's the <hi>fruit</hi> ye have brought forth? where's your growth of grace? Well, look to it: God will reckon for them: And thus God tempts and tries ſinners with his <hi>patience</hi> and long-ſuffering, he hath made his <hi>ciſterns</hi> to run with Wine of <hi>proſperity</hi> and <hi>health</hi> upon them: And <hi>knoweſt thou not, O man, that the goodneſs of God leads thee to repentance?</hi> Oh take heed: Sinner, thou haſt been long upon thy trial: I ſay, God hath been trying how theſe would work.</p>
            <p>5. God tempts by <hi>objects</hi> and <hi>occaſions.</hi> As ſometimes you will lay a piece of money in the way of a <hi>child</hi> or <hi>ſervant,</hi> to try their <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> and prove their <hi>truth,</hi> whether they will pilfer or ſteal yea or no; that you may know whether you may truſt them hereafter, or not; ſo doth God tempt and try the Sons of men, by preſenting them with objects and occaſions; that is, unlawful objects, and occaſions to ſin. This is an holy Act of God, for he doth not <hi>move</hi> the heart<note place="margin">
                  <hi>God</hi> tempted or tryed <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> when he had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: but behold brave <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi>
               </note> to ſin, only <hi>preſents</hi> the outward object to try the heart.</p>
            <p>The goodly fruit of the <hi>tree of knowledg</hi> was a ſtanding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in our parents eye to try them every day: It was there in their eye, yet <hi>forbidden fruit;</hi> they could not but ſee it, yet they muſt not touch it.</p>
            <p>So, Sirs, Gods Providence preſents you with various ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, it preſents ſome with beauties, with honours, with a rich protion, with a wedg of gold; What ſhould we do now in this caſe? ſay, here's a <hi>temptation,</hi> a <hi>trial</hi> from the Lord upon me; and be ſure we be jealous of our <hi>eye</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some (it may be) will think Providence lays this object in
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55699:110"/> my way, therefore I may be medling with it: Oh no; we muſt not make the <hi>Providence,</hi> but the <hi>Precept</hi> of God our only Rule: and know that God tempts us, and tries us by objects and occaſions.</p>
            <p>6. God tempts by <hi>delays:</hi> Sinners tempt God by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of <hi>repentance,</hi> and God tempts his people by his delay of <hi>anſwers;</hi> they pray, and he defers; they preſs him to anſwer, and he delays: God (as you heard) promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> a Son, and by his delay (as it were) <hi>denieth</hi> performance; for delay bears the <hi>image</hi> and <hi>ſemblance</hi> of denial: and God makes him wait five and twenty years for performance. Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are heavy, they are biting and cutting temptations: A ſhort affliction ſeems long, but length of affliction adds weight unto it, and puts many grains into it; Oh! it is a ſore temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and yet thus God tempts and tries his people; they call to day, and he comes not; then they cry, and cry aloud, and yet he hears not: and this makes them cry, <hi>How long, how</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 35. 17.</note> 
               <hi>long, Lord! Lord, how long wilt thou look on? Reſcue my ſoul from their deſtructions, my darling from the lyons. How long,</hi>

               <hi>Lord, wilt thou be angry for ever? ſhall thy jealouſie burn like fire?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>how longs</hi> are great temptations to our natures: and this may be thy caſe, poor ſoul, and then you will find this <hi>how long</hi> a bitter temptation.</p>
            <p>7. God alſo tempts by way of Denial, and in ſome things this is a ſore trial; for if <hi>delay</hi> be a great temptation, <hi>Denial</hi> muſt needs be a very great one; we ſue to God for a thing that is deſirable, we long for it, and God ſaith, <hi>no,</hi> to our ſuits: We ask for the life of ſuch a friend, or relation, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with a <hi>negative vote;</hi> we lift up our hands for <hi>deliverance</hi> out of the Cloud of ſuch afflictions, and the hand of God makes it <hi>thicker</hi> and <hi>darker</hi> on us: we move God for great mercies, and he gives us great Denials: This is to put our ſubmiſſion to the trial, to put our reſignation to his Will and Wiſdom, to the trial; our patience under his Soveraignty; to the trial.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Fill the ſoul with Gods <hi>infiniteneſs:</hi> Gods way is not your way (<hi>ſaith faith</hi>), nor his thoughts as your thoughts; but as the Heavens are above the earth, ſo are his thoughts beyond yours, and his ways beyond yours: Faith lodgeth this <hi>principle</hi> in the ſoul, that God is <hi>infinite;</hi> and having laid that principle there, when difficulties and diſcouragements ariſe, ſaying, You ſee now in what diſtreſs you are brought, now you ſee there is no hope at all of your deliverance; true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſaith the believer; I ſee there's no way in <hi>reaſon,</hi> in any ones reaſon, but God is <hi>infinite:</hi> I ſee many difficulties, but God is infinite: the ſoul by faith being filled with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Gods Infiniteneſs, is carried unto him through all difficulties and diſcouragements: <hi>Now to him that is able to</hi>

            </p>
            <p>2. Let thy faith lay up, and lay hold on this principle, that <hi>Gods love</hi> is <hi>immutable:</hi> Soul, whom God <hi>once</hi> loves, he <hi>ever</hi> loves: hath he loved thee? then he can never unlove thee: <hi>With him there's no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning:</hi> Fix here then, it is a ſtrong <hi>electuary</hi> in a day of <hi>fainting:</hi> afflicted Saint, what's the matter? My ſtroaks are from God himſelf: yet he loves thee: But God hath hid his face from me yet he loves thee.</p>
            <p>3. Act faith in temptation, that God will be <hi>with you:</hi> he will be at thine elbow; you know that bleſſed promiſe, <hi>I will not fail thee, nor forſake thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. In trials and temptations act your faith in this, that God <hi>governs</hi> and <hi>moderates</hi> all temptations; there's never a temptation, but it is from Divine <hi>ordination,</hi> and therefore is managed by the reins of Divine <hi>moderation:</hi> ſo that as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Rider rules the horſe, and the skilful Coach-man by his dexterity guides the Coach; ſo the wiſe and merciful God governs the temptation, he holds the temptation in his hand with Curb and Bridle; he <hi>allots</hi> it its bounds, and graciouſly <hi>preſcribes</hi> its meaſure, ſo that it ſhall not be upon you out of meaſure; Oh! what a rare comfort is this to a poor ſoul, that a God ſo good, <hi>circumſcribes</hi> temptation within limits; it may <hi>flow in</hi> upon you, but ſhall not <hi>over-flow</hi> you; I ſay, it ſhall
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55699:112"/> not overflow the banks, God himſelf will <hi>keep</hi> and <hi>bound</hi> it within its channel; its Waves may <hi>drench</hi> you, but they ſhall not <hi>drown</hi> you: The Great God that ſaith to the Sea, <hi>Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhall thy proud waves go, and no farther,</hi> the ſame God ſits upon the <hi>waters</hi> of every temptation.</p>
            <p>5. In all your trials and temptations, act your faith upon this principle, that <hi>God will extract good out of them;</hi> this is the <hi>Royal prerogative</hi> of God to do ſo; it is his <hi>peculiar,</hi> and he <hi>will</hi> do ſo; it is ſpoken of him as one of his <hi>incommunicable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,</hi> that <hi>God commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs:</hi> It is the property of the <hi>Devil</hi> to draw <hi>evil</hi> out of good, and <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> out of light; but it is the ſweet property of a gracious God to draw <hi>good</hi> out of evil, and <hi>light</hi> out of darkneſs; he will turn the ſhadow of death into the morning; tempted ſouls, the Lord who tries you, will extract good out of your trials and temptations.</p>

Think not the <hi>worſe</hi> of the ſtate of grace, becauſe of trials and temptations: Be not diſcouraged in it: It is <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>gracious God</hi> that tempts <hi>Abraham,</hi> and will tempt and try <hi>his Saints:</hi> and theſe temptations the Devil makes uſe of to work your hearts back again: When ye were in your <hi>natural</hi> condition, then your <hi>heart</hi> was quiet, your <hi>conſcience</hi> quiet, and the <hi>devil</hi> quiet, and your <hi>friends</hi> quiet, and did not ſpeak evil of you; and the <hi>world</hi> quiet, and did not hate you nor trouble you: But now you begin to look toward <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> now <hi>conſcience</hi> condemns, now the <hi>Devil</hi> accuſeth, now your <hi>friends,</hi> your <hi>former</hi> friends, they ſpeak evil of you, the <hi>world</hi> abuſeth you, your <hi>neighbours</hi> ſcorn and moleſt you:
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55699:113"/> I appeal to thee [man or woman] in thine own ſoul; Doſt thou not think that thy former condition was an ungodly condition? Yes, I confeſs, yes; and yet then thou waſt quiet, then conſcience quiet, then friends quiet, then Satan quiet, but now conſcience accuſeth, and now Satan accuſeth, and the world accuſeth, and friends ſpeak evil: Oh, ſay then, my condition is now far better; when I was bad, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was dangerous, then all was quiet, and therefore my condition now with trials and temptations is far better.</p>
            <p>When I was going to <hi>hell,</hi> all was quiet; when I was like to be <hi>loſt,</hi> then all was quiet, and therefore I will not change ſtates with my ſelf for all the world; I would not be in my former loſt condition with all my quietneſs for a thouſand worlds: I will prize my condition of faith and grace with trials and troubles infinitely above my former condition, come what will come: Gods Wormwood is better than the Devils Honey. Well then, be not diſcouraged, 'twas God that did, and doth try his Saints.</p>

            <p>You know not what dear <hi>Iſaac,</hi> what precious jewel God will have thee part with, and ſacrifice to him.</p>

            <p>There's never a perſon in this Congregation knows what day of difficulty and temptation is coming over him; not one of you knows what hot ſervice God hath yet for you: Little did <hi>Abraham</hi> think <hi>a day before,</hi> to hear that command from God, <hi>Go and ſacrifice thy Son, thy only Son Iſaac:</hi> Little doſt thou know, how ſoon God will ſay to thee, Be ſick, be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and terrified in conſcience; how ſoon he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his face, give thee up to doubtings and terrors: little doſt thou know how ſoon God may ſay unto thee, as he did to <hi>Moſes, Go up to mount Nebo and dye:</hi> Oh then, ſtore up ſtrength for great and hard ſervices and temptations.</p>

            <p>1. Ye heard, that to a lawful temptation; he that tempts and trieth, muſt have [<hi>jus tendandi</hi>] a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> to tempt; God being our Lord, and the ſupream <hi>Rector,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving abſolute government over us, hath [an <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 7. Saints, look upon your daily afflictions, as your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>1. They are ſent from God upon you, as your temptations, to <hi>try</hi> you and <hi>refine</hi> you: Obſerve then with what <hi>humility</hi> you receive them, for they are ſent to <hi>try</hi> your humility; obſerve with what patience and meekneſs you bear them, for they come to try your patience: obſerve into what nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you concoct them, for you muſt feed upon them, and eat them, to kill corrupt humours, and to breed good blood and ſpirits: I ſay, obſerve then what fruits they bring forth, for though <hi>they are not joyous, but grievious for the preſent:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note> 
               <hi>yet afterward they yield,</hi> (or God looks they ſhould yield) <hi>the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs unto them which are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereby.</hi> God will come to you, as the Maſter did to the fig-tree, to ſeek fruit on you: I muſt tell you, God expects as much fruit from your <hi>temptations,</hi> as from your <hi>mercies:</hi> Gods Eye is upon you, he looks what you are doing.</p>
            <p>2. Afflictions (<hi>per accidens,</hi> through our corruptions) are great temptations to ſin, and therefore you had need ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your ſelves ſtrictly under your daily afflictions: I ſay, they are great temptations to ſin: for though it be ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>that he was in all points tempted like as we are, yet</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> 
               <hi>without ſin:</hi> But in our infirmity of the fleſh, we are ſeldom tempted by afflictions, without ſin: Although affliction doth not quite vanquiſh and overcome us, yet always almoſt at the very firſt on-ſet, it doth (like a great blow) <hi>dizzy</hi> the brain, and makes us <hi>give back:</hi> If we be not thrown down, yet we reel and ſtagger; and ſometimes it lays us flat, and our faith lyes <hi>ſprawling</hi> upon the ground: In affliction there are two things:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Senſation.</hi> And</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In affliction there is <hi>Senſation [doloris ſenſus</hi>] the ſenſe of pain and grief, and this <hi>Chriſt</hi> felt as well as <hi>we:</hi> we <hi>cannot,</hi> and he <hi>could not</hi> taſte affliction without pain: as <hi>we</hi> are affected with Dolour, when evils lye upon us; ſo was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he felt ſharp and keen pain. and thus <hi>Chriſt was tempted in all things,</hi> and in the ſame manner, <hi>as we are,</hi> as to <hi>ſenſe</hi> of pain and grief, yet <hi>without ſin.</hi> But,</p>
            <pb n="312" facs="tcp:55699:115"/>
            <p>2. In affliction there is alſo <hi>temptation</hi> to ſin: and becauſe it is ſo true, that great temptations ariſe out of afflictions, therefore are afflictions <hi>Antonomaſtice</hi> called temptations, they tempt ſadly to murmuring and impatience, to wrangling and expoſtulation with God, to unbelief and doubting of his love, nay, to caſt off God: Doth God himſelf tempt me thus, and afflict me thus? and ſhall I ſerve ſuch a Maſter? Ah! look how ye are under your daily afflictions.</p>

            <p>1. He tempts his dear ones; he tempts thoſe whom he loves dearly: <hi>Abraham</hi> was high in Gods Books, one of his intimate and boſom-acquaintance, and yet God tempts <hi>Abraham:</hi> Nay, to give you a greater inſtance than <hi>Abraham, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was tempted: I ſay, Jeſus Chriſt <hi>was</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> 
               <hi>in all points tempted like as we are,</hi> and yet the <hi>beloved</hi> of the Lord: he was the <hi>tempted,</hi> and yet the <hi>beloved</hi> of the Lord: he was <hi>tempted</hi>

            <p>So that ye may be the tempted, and yet the beloved of the Lord: nay, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was tempted of God himſelf: he was not only tempted by the <hi>tempter,</hi> but by his <hi>dear Father,</hi> God himſelf: <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. All is in <hi>love:</hi> he tempts in love: he not only tempts his beloved, but he tempts them in love: that <hi>he</hi> may love them the more, and <hi>they</hi> in the Iſſue love him the better: How much more did God love <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he ſaw him forget himſelf to be a Father, and his own child to be his Son, for his ſake?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By my ſelf have I ſworn</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>for becauſe thou</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>haſt done this thing, and haſt not withheld thy Son, thine only Son: That in bleſſing, I will bleſs thee, and in multiplying, I will multiply thy ſeed as the ſtars of the heaven, and as the ſand which is upon the Sea-ſhore: and thy ſeed ſhall poſſeſs the gate of his enemies:</hi> And did not this meſſage from heaven (think you) kindle a greater flame of love in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God? without doubt it did: God loves <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:55699:115"/> more, <hi>Abraham</hi> loves God more than ever he did: When <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſaw Gods deſign, and had his Son delivered ſafe to him again, How was his heart filled with a ſpiritual <hi>torrent</hi> of joy! He gained the experience of Gods love to him, and of his love to God, and would not have unwiſhed the temptation again upon any terms.</p>
            <p>3. God tempts, and all is in wiſdom: God tempts his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in wiſdom: he corrects his <hi>Children,</hi> as well as his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> but when he corrects them, it is in much prudence and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall I know that God tempts me for my</hi> good? <hi>How ſhall I know that God afflicts me, and tempts me in love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Why, <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe he loves thee: whom he loves, he tempts and proves them in love: you imagine he loves you, but you do not feel that he loves you: the ſenſe of Gods love would put all theſe out of doubt.</p>
            <p>2. You may know he tempts you in love, if ye be <hi>faithful</hi> unto him in temptations: if you <hi>depart not</hi> from God in the day of temptation: God is trying and tempting his people at this day, and it may be it will be a ſad day, and a dark day of temptation; it may be it will be a ſtrong day of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of long temptation: and you would know whether he tempts you at this day in love, then make choice of <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> rather than <hi>ſin,</hi> of <hi>affliction</hi> rather than <hi>defection: The</hi>

For temptation to ſin, as having a <hi>power</hi> or <hi>cauſality</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us thereunto: As for Chriſts ſufferings, they were exactly like unto ours: To that end he took a Body and Soul, and in his ſtate of humiliation lay actually under them, and felt them: As for temptation to ſin, that is <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>outward:</hi> Inwardly indeed he was not tempted, but outwardly he was, by men and devils, more than ever man was, and was tempted to the ſame kind of ſins (at leaſt ſome of them) which we being tempted to commit, yet he never ſinned.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle tells you there, <hi>that he is touched with the feeling of our infirmities: [We have not an High prieſt which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities</hi>]; Nay, becauſe he was <hi>tempted</hi> like as we are, he cannot but be <hi>touched</hi> with the feeling of our infirmities, that is, he cannot but be <hi>inwardly affected</hi> with the ſenſe of our temptations. Sirs, your tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions touch <hi>him,</hi> the temptations that you feel touch him: his very bowels are full of the feeling of <hi>your</hi> infirmities, he is acted with mercy and compaſſion towards you, and he would have man to know it: That which is the object of his compaſſion, is our infirmities, that is, <hi>ſins</hi> of the ſoul, and <hi>pains</hi> of the body, but chiefly ſin; infirmity here is <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>puniſhment, ſin</hi> and <hi>ſuffering,</hi> which makes our caſe very miſerable: Some will think that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not touched with the feeling of my ſins, others will
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55699:117"/> think Chriſt is not touched with the feeling of my ſorrows: but ye are miſtaken, poor ſouls, ye are miſtaken; ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> we have an High prieſt that is touched with the feeling of our infirmities, with the ſenſe and feeling of both, of your <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>guilt,</hi> of your <hi>ſorrows</hi> and <hi>ſufferings:</hi> Whatever troubles <hi>you,</hi> troubles <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and the reaſon why he is ſo ſenſible of our ſad conditions, is, becauſe <hi>he was tempted in all points like unto us:</hi> Chriſt as <hi>God,</hi> is infinitely merciful; but he became <hi>man, tempted man,</hi> that he might be <hi>ſenſible</hi> of our infirmities with our own <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affections;</hi> that he might pity man with the affections of a man, with ſuch affections as we are wont to pity one another; and therefore he was not only <hi>man,</hi> but a <hi>tempted man,</hi> becauſe <hi>experimental</hi> knowledg, and <hi>practical</hi> ſenſe, is the moſt effectual.</p>
            <p>Hearken then, you tempted ſouls, how deeply is Chriſt touched with the feeling of your infirmities, who was himſelf a <hi>tempted man,</hi> as <hi>ye</hi> are; he was in all points tempted like unto us: This is that <hi>wonderful way</hi> which God by his <hi>profound Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> contrived to make his mercy <hi>greater</hi> (and in ſome ſort) <hi>more than infinite:</hi> he would have a kind of <hi>knowledg</hi> of <hi>mans</hi> infirmities, which as <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Infinite,</hi> he could never have.</p>

               <hi>rebellious generation, that ſet not their heart aright: and whoſe ſpirit was not ſtedfaſt with God.</hi> He warns them againſt <hi>Rebellion,</hi> becauſe their <hi>Anceſtors</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> ſinned at that rate, and were ſeverely puniſhed by God.

               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That to ſay, our <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> did thus and thus, therefore ſo will <hi>we,</hi> is no good argument: Shall <hi>we</hi> be wiſer than our <hi>Forefathers?</hi> yes, that you muſt, or elſe you may ſmart for it.

            <p>What time the <hi>Prophet</hi> (whoever he was) penned this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is uncertain; yet becauſe he gives us the Hiſtory of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs, and in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> down to <hi>David</hi> when he was King; it therefore ſeems probable, that it was written either in the later days of <hi>David,</hi> or elſe in the days of <hi>Solomon.</hi> The <hi>Pſalm</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a long <hi>ſeries</hi> and concatenation of Gods <hi>kindneſſes</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iſraels ingratitude</hi> towards God, and then the Divine puniſhments upon that ungrateful people.</p>
            <p>Gods free love drops benefits and wonders upon them, and then their ingratitude extorts puniſhments from him: Thus it pourtrayes Gods dealings of <hi>mercy</hi> with his people, and never in juſtice, but when mercy was abuſed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Contexture</hi> of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is to ſet out one while Gods benefits to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> another while their ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, and then his juſt puniſhments upon them: thus it looks like Hangings of <hi>Arras,</hi> pictured with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed Rows of various Colours.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sinful man is ſo bold and impudent, as to tempt the Lord God:</hi>
               <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Iſa. 7. 13.</note> And herein, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Hear ye now, O houſe of David; Is it a ſmall thing for you to weary me? but will ye weary my God alſo?</hi> So may I ſay unto you, Hear ye now, Is it a ſmall thing unto you to tempt men, to tempt one another? but will ye tempt God alſo? In the handling of this point, I muſt ſhew you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, What it is to tempt God:</hi> To tempt one in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is to make a <hi>tryal</hi> of one.</p>
            <p>1. Either concerning his Qualities, whether he be <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> whether he be <hi>real,</hi> or <hi>counterfeit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Or concerning his <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> to you. Thus you will make a tryal of a friend, that profeſſeth love to you; it may be you will go to him, and ask to borrow a ſum of money of him, only to try him, and his good-will to you: and this is to tempt him.</p>
            <p>3. Or concerning his <hi>abilities;</hi> What a man can do. Thus we try <hi>Scholars</hi> in the Univerſity, for their degrees; and thus perſons, learning, and parts are (or ought to be tryed) when they enter into the <hi>ſacred function</hi> of the Miniſtry, whether they are fit for that great work of the Lord: thus we ſet men to preach or expound Scripture, to try them how they can preach or expound the Scripture: And this is to tempt them. And thus the Sons of men tempt <hi>God,</hi> and try him. To tempt God is to make a tryal of him, whether God be <hi>amnipotent,</hi> or <hi>faithful,</hi> and <hi>true</hi> in his word; I ſay, to make a tryal, whether God <hi>knows</hi> and <hi>ſees</hi> our actions, or whether God <hi>can do</hi> ſuch a thing, or <hi>will do</hi> ſuch a thing for you; and this is to tempt God, and thus men tempt the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of God, and the <hi>Power</hi> of God, and the <hi>Will</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>And thus you may tempt God [<hi>verbis vel factis</hi>], in <hi>words,</hi> or in <hi>deeds.</hi> To tempt in Scripture hath a <hi>threefold</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</p>
            <pb n="321" facs="tcp:55699:119"/>
            <p>1. Sometimes it ſignifies to <hi>try,</hi> to make a tryal of one: and thus men tempt God (as you have heard).</p>
            <p>2. To <hi>provoke</hi> and <hi>irritate;</hi> and thus ſome take it in the 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 9. Neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted:</hi> Let us not tempt, that is, <hi>provoke</hi> Chriſt, as it is in <hi>verſ. 22. Do we provoke the Lord to jealouſie? are we ſtronger than he?</hi> They that provoke God, do (as it were) challenge him into the field, and try what he can do, or what he will do.</p>
            <p>3. To tempt [in <hi>Scripture</hi>] is to <hi>ſollicite</hi> to evil: as when <hi>Satan</hi> tempted Chriſt, and tempts men, and when one ſinner tempts another to ſin; and thus alſo men tempt God, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men will tempt God to ſin, they will try whether they can draw God in to ſin with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Schools</hi> diſtinguiſh mans Temptation of God, <hi>firſt</hi> into a <hi>direct,</hi> and <hi>ſecondly interpretative</hi> tempting of God.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>direct</hi> tempting of God, is when a man by word or deed intends to tempt God, and try him whether he be <hi>wiſe,</hi> or <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>can,</hi> or <hi>will</hi> do ſuch a thing; when we intend to tempt God, then it is a direct and intentional Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</p>
            <p>2. There is an <hi>interpretative</hi> tempting of God; when though we intend not to tempt him, yet we do the ſame thing which he doth, who hath a deſign and deſire to tempt God: So that this ſin may be committed, when you do not intend it; you may tempt God, when you have no expreſs purpoſe to do it; when you do that which is <hi>ordinable</hi> to nothing elſe, but to make a tryal or experience of God, and to prove his Power, or Goodneſs, or Knowledg.</p>
            <p>As when a man goes on in a wretched courſe of life, and yet hopes to find mercy at the hour of death, he intends not (it may be) to try Gods mercy, yet he doth that which is good for nothing but to make an experience of his mercy.</p>
            <p>3. You muſt know that,</p>
            <p>1. There is a <hi>good</hi> or <hi>lawful</hi> tempting of God.</p>
            <p>2. There is a <hi>ſinful</hi> tempting of God: There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and there is an unwarrantable tempting of God.</p>
            <p>1. There is a good and commendable temptation of God, which is lawful; which is ſo, when it ſprings,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A bono principio,</hi> from a <hi>good principle,</hi> or an holy heart and purpoſe.</p>
            <pb n="322" facs="tcp:55699:120"/>
            <p>2. When it is done in a <hi>lawful way,</hi> or by a <hi>good action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When it is bottomed upon a <hi>good ground;</hi> that is,</p>
            <p>1. When we have a <hi>call</hi> from God to it, his <hi>command</hi> and <hi>promiſe</hi> to bear us out.</p>
            <p>2. When we have a <hi>juſt</hi> neceſſity to do it.</p>
            <p>4. It is a lawful tempting of God, when it tends to a <hi>good end:</hi> This is a <hi>lawful</hi> tempting of God, when it proceeds from a good principle, and is done by good means, and tends<note place="margin">Tentatio bons eſt quae ex prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio bono ſeu animo ſancto, ac bono medio ſeu mode<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> bonum finem tendit.</note> to a good end, and (as you heard alſo) is bottomed upon a good ground, a lawful call, and a juſt neceſſity to tempt and try God.</p>
            <p>1. To make our tempting and trying of God <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> it muſt ſpring from a <hi>good principle,</hi> or an <hi>holy</hi> heart, that is, a <hi>love</hi> of knowing the Truth, or Power, or Juſtice of God: When we make a Tryal of God out of love to God, and his glorious Attributes, that we may be raviſhed with the beauty and ſplendour of them.</p>
            <p>2. It is a <hi>lawful</hi> tempting of God, when we have a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> to try him: and then we ſin in not tempting God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. When the Lord had promiſed what he would do for <hi>Judah,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and what he would do againſt <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> (ſaith he to encourage <hi>Abaz</hi> faith) in <hi>ver. 11. Ask thee a ſign of the Lord thy God: ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</hi> As if he had ſaid, For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of <hi>thy</hi> faith, and the aſſurance of the truth of <hi>Gods</hi> word, <hi>ask a ſign,</hi> that is, try God by asking ſomewhat to be done, ſome <hi>unuſual</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> thing to be done by him; thus make a tryal and experience of him, whether he means as he ſaith, whether his heart agrees with his word; to know this, <hi>ask a ſign,</hi> make a tryal, put him to it: No, ſaith <hi>Ahaz, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.</hi> You<note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> would think this was Religiouſly, but it was Hypocritically ſpoken; he pretended he would not <hi>ſin,</hi> that if he ask't a ſign, he ſhould go againſt the Command in <hi>Deut. 6. 16. Ye ſhall not tempt the Lord your God, as ye tempted him in Maſſah.</hi> As if a man ſhould tempt God, by doing that which he is invited by God himſelf to do. <hi>Ahaz</hi> here had a <hi>Command</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:55699:120"/> to try God: it was Gods gracious indulgence, and kind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcent to <hi>Ahaz</hi> to bid him <hi>ask a ſign,</hi> that is, if thou art hard to believe me, <hi>ask a ſign,</hi> and try me, I give thee this offer, but he would not; it was his rebellion not to tempt or try God, when he had a Command to tempt and try him. And herein was his ſin alſo the greater, becauſe God would have given King <hi>Ahaz</hi> a ſign, not for <hi>himſelf</hi> only, but for the edification and inſtruction of the <hi>whole people;</hi> and therefore he is reproved, as an hinderer of the common good, and publick ſalvation, in that he would not ask a ſign.</p>
            <p>3. It is a lawful tempting or tryal of God, when there is a <hi>juſt neceſſity;</hi> when we really ſtand in need of his <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary appearance:</hi> when <hi>ordinary means</hi> fail, then to truſt in him, and expect his <hi>unuſual</hi> preſence, it is not unlawful. Thus when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſued <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his <hi>Army</hi> was in the Rear of them, and the <hi>Red-ſea</hi> before them, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Stand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord, which</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 13.</note> 
               <hi>he will ſhew to you, to day.</hi> And when the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in the wilderneſs, and could have no bread, nor could meet with water, then they were to <hi>try</hi> what God could do for them, and to <hi>expect</hi> relief from him out of the <hi>ordinary</hi> courſe: they were <hi>called</hi> by God into the wilderneſs, and therefore had a <hi>call</hi> to try God, and ſeek experiments of his mercy and power for them.</p>
            <p>4. It is a <hi>lawful</hi> tempting of God, when it is to a <hi>good end.</hi>

            <p>1. As for confirmation of our faith: thus <hi>Gideon</hi> tempted, or proved God, <hi>Judg. 6. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 verſes.</hi> And <hi>Gideon ſaid unto God, If thou wilt ſave Iſrael by mine hand as thou haſt ſaid, Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor: and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the the earth beſide, then ſhall I know that thou wilt ſave Iſrael by mine hand, as thou haſt ſaid. And it was ſo for he roſe up early on the morrow, and thruſt the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</hi> Where faith he at the <hi>39th</hi> verſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>, <hi>let me tempt,</hi> or prove, I pray thee, <hi>but this once with the fleece. Gideon</hi> being conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his own infirmity and weakneſs, and out of a deſire to obey God, and for the confirmation of his faith, and his more cheerful obedience in a moſt dangerous deſign which God had ſet him upon, <hi>asked,</hi> and <hi>obtained</hi> a ſign: I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55699:121"/> he ask'd this ſign by an <hi>inſtinct</hi> and <hi>impulſe</hi> from God himſelf.</p>
            <p>2. When it is for Gods glory, and the publick good; for the ſalvation of ſouls, and the progreſs of the Goſpel, and the ſplendour of Chriſts name: And thus the Apoſtles prayed that God would be with them in their Miniſtry, <hi>by ſtretching forth his hand to heal, and that ſigns and wonders might</hi>

            </p>
            <p>2. There is a <hi>ſinful</hi> tempting of God: A ſinful tempting of God is, which wants thoſe <hi>conditions,</hi> or <hi>ingredients</hi> ſpoken of before. Briefly thus, [<hi>Quae principio, medio, aut fine peccat</hi>], a ſinful tempting of God is, that which fails in <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, means,</hi> or <hi>end.</hi> You ſhall ſee an inſtance of this ſinful tempting of God in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 15. to 22. <hi>Then went the Phariſees, and took counſel, how they might intangle him in his talk. And they ſent out unto him their diſciples, with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodians, ſaying, Maſter, we know that thou art true, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the way of God in truth, neither careſt thou for any man; for thou regardeſt not the perſons of men. Tell us therefore, what thinkeſt thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caeſar, or not? But Jeſus perceived their wickedneſs, and ſaid, Why tempt ye me ye hypocrites? Shew me the tribute money, and they brought unto him a penny. And he ſaid unto them, Whoſe is this image, and ſuperſcription? They ſay unto him, Caeſars. Then ſaith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caeſar, the things</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 21.</note> 
               <hi>that are Caeſars; and unto God, the things which are Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They came to Chriſt, that they might tempt him, that is, to try what he would ſay, to ſee what words would drop from him, which they might gather up to his hurt: And their tempting of Chriſt ſprang not,</p>
            <p>1. From an <hi>holy,</hi> but a <hi>wicked</hi> principle, not a love of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>juſtneſs</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of Chriſt, but an <hi>hatred</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Medium,</hi> or means they uſed, was as bad; they commended him to the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies, that they might cut his throat. [<hi>Maſter, we know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth, neither careſt thou for any man; for thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeſt not the perſon of men. Tell us therefore, what thinkeſt thou? Is it lawful to pay tribute unto Caeſar, or not?</hi> Did ye ever hear ſuch <hi>gilded flattery?</hi> Though they ſpake nothing <hi>but</hi> truth, yet nothing did they ſpeak <hi>in</hi> truth, here was no
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55699:121"/> 
               <hi>ſincerity</hi> in their ſpeech, but a <hi>cunning ſimulation</hi> of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, honeſty, and fidelity.</p>
            <p>3. Their <hi>end</hi> was <hi>bloody</hi> and <hi>cruel,</hi> in all theſe <hi>fair ſpeeches</hi> they ſought the blood of Chriſt; they <hi>tempted</hi> him, <hi>that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> 
               <hi>they might entangle him in his ſpeech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Here was an <hi>intentional</hi> tempting of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. They tempted him with their <hi>words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Their <hi>end</hi> was to deſtroy him.</p>
            <p>Again, in a <hi>ſinful</hi> tempting of God, this is alſo another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, when we make a tryal of him, [<hi>Sine vocatione, ſine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate, ſine cauſa</hi>], without a <hi>call,</hi> without <hi>neceſſity,</hi> without a <hi>cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Sinful tempting of God, is either [in <hi>exceſſu,</hi> or <hi>defectu</hi>] in the <hi>exceſs,</hi> or <hi>defect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In the <hi>defect,</hi> when God is tempted, by our unbelief, diffidence, diſtruſt, and doubting of his power, preſence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and will, to do any thing for us; ſo men tempt God, [<hi>Omittendo quod oportet</hi>] in omitting what ought to be done by them.</p>
            <p>2. In the <hi>exceſs;</hi> when God is tempted, [<hi>nimia confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia</hi>], by too much confidence; when with the <hi>abuſe</hi> of his promiſes, and the <hi>neglect</hi> of the Divine Method and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he hath preſcribed, they will preſume of Gods Preſence, and ſeek a tryal of his aſſiſtance, and expect his mercy and preſervation. To conclude, when men in <hi>doing</hi> what they<note place="margin">Sive faciendo quod non opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet, ſive omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendo quod oportet.</note> ought not, or in <hi>omitting</hi> what they ought to do, [<hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectu licitorum, vel uſu illicitorum</hi>], in the <hi>neglect</hi> of things lawful, or the <hi>uſe</hi> of things unlawful, they ſeek a tryal, or experiment of the favour or power of God, they tempt him ſinfully: and of this <hi>ſinful</hi> tempting of God doth our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſpeak, when it ſaith, Sinful man is ſo bold and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to tempt the Lord God. And of this I ſhall ſhew you,</p>
            <p>1. That ſinful man is ſo bold as to <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>try</hi> God.</p>
            <p>2. It is a <hi>ſin</hi> thus to tempt and try the Lord God.</p>
            <p>3. Why doth ſinful man tempt and try God?</p>
            <p>4. And then, what we have ſhewed but in the general, we ſhall ſhew you in <hi>particulars,</hi> what it is to tempt God in a ſinful way.</p>
            <p>1. Sinful man is ſo bold as to tempt God: You may ſee this in the <hi>18th verſe</hi> of this <hi>Pſalm, And they tempted God
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55699:122"/> in their heart, by asking meat for their luſt.</hi> And in my Text, <hi>They tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Iſrael.</hi> And at the <hi>56th verſe, They tempted, and provoked the moſt high God, and kept not his teſtimonies.</hi> And when I ſay, that ſinful man is ſo bold as to tempt God, I wrap up the godly alſo in this expreſſion: For, though they are godly, yet they are not perfectly godly; indeed they are ſinfully godly, I mean, they have ſin in them mingled with their godlineſs; I ſay then, that good and gracious men ſometimes tempt the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zacharias</hi> tempted God: The <hi>Scripture</hi> gives him and his<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 6.</note> wife this character, That <hi>they were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord, blameleſs:</hi> and yet <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſinfully tempted God. You know, while he was executing the Prieſts office, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto him an Angel of the Lord, and told him, <hi>Thy wife Elizabeth ſhall bear thee a Son, and thou ſhalt call his name</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> 
               <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Zacharias ſaid unto the Angel,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <hi>whereby ſhall I know this?</hi> Here he tempted and tryed God, <hi>verbis,</hi> in words or ſpeech; How ſhall I know the <hi>truth</hi> of God in this meſſage? <hi>For I am an old man, and my wife well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricken in years;</hi> that is, we are both <hi>unlikely</hi> for ſuch a thing; and therefore [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <hi>the day that theſe things ſhall be performed:</hi> He ſhall ask no more queſtions for forty weeks, becauſe he asked this one diſtruſtfully.</p>
            <p>2. It is a <hi>ſin</hi> thus to tempt and try the Lord God.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe it is againſt the Royal Command: his Regal Authority hath forbidden us to tempt him, <hi>ye ſhall not tempt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 16.</note> [<hi>or try] the Lord God,</hi> and therefore <hi>Jeſus Chriſt himſelf</hi> durſt not do it. When Satan, having ſet him upon a <hi>Pinacle</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 4. 5, 6, 7.</note> of the Temple, ſaid unto him, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down: Chriſt</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>It is written,</hi> [that is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 16. There (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>it is written] Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="327" facs="tcp:55699:122"/>
            <p>2. To tempt and try God, is againſt the <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> reſpect to God, which the creature ſhould bear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him: we may tempt our <hi>inferiour,</hi> but it is boldneſs to tempt our <hi>ſuperiour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In every ſuch Temptation, or tempting of God, there is an undervaluing of God. Will the Lord be gracious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me? I will try him: thus we tempt the goodneſs of the Lord: thus we tempt God, becauſe we ſuſpect his Power, and his Goodneſs and Ability.</p>
            <p>3. Why does ſinful man tempt God, and try him?</p>
            <p>1. Sometimes it ſprings from <hi>unbelief,</hi> and doubting of Gods Power, and his Promiſes, <hi>Exod. 7. 17. Is the Lord among us or not?</hi> In the wilderneſs of the Children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, was a <hi>doubting</hi> of Gods Care and Providence, and Power and Wiſdom, of which they had ſo many arguments, aſſurances, and promiſes from him.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 22. Their tempting of God ten times, ſprang from their not believing him in <hi>all his ſigns which he had ſhewed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> 
               <hi>among them,</hi> and what that unbelief was, appears by their words at the <hi>2d verſe, Would God that we had died in the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> 
               <hi>land of Egypt, or would God we had died in this wilderneſs: And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land, to fall by the ſword, that our wives, and our children ſhould be a prey?</hi> Thinking that God <hi>could not</hi> preſerve them, or elſe <hi>would not</hi> go along with, but leave them to be devoured by the people of the land: as you may ſee at the <hi>9th verſe.</hi> Now if you ask, why ſinful men tempt God, it is from <hi>unbelief;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſprings from <hi>preſumption,</hi> believing more than God has promiſed: they hope to be ſaved, although they live in ſin; they are too confident, and have too much faith, they are over-believing.</p>
            <p>4. What is it ſinfully to tempt and try God? You muſt know (as you have heard already) that man may tempt God, [<hi>Et in exceſſu, &amp; in defectu</hi>], both in the <hi>exceſs,</hi> and in <hi>defect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. They tempt God, who neglect <hi>ſecond cauſes,</hi> and uſe<note place="margin">Neglectu lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum.</note> not <hi>means</hi> which God hath preſcribed: when thou expecteſt <hi>God alone</hi> to help thee, or give thee a mercy, which thou oughteſt to come to by thy <hi>own labour</hi> and <hi>co-operation,</hi> this is to tempt and try both the <hi>Power</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> of God.</p>
            <pb n="328" facs="tcp:55699:123"/>
            <p>They that will not labour with their hands, but put it upon God to provide for them, theſe tempt the Lord: they that will not <hi>manage</hi> their eſtates, but put it upon God to help them, they ſin moſt grievouſly. It is true, <hi>Gods</hi> Providence doth all things, yet <hi>thy</hi> Providence muſt work with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as a ſervant under it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22. It is ſaid, <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord, it maketh rich:</hi> and yet at the <hi>14th verſe,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>The hand of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent maketh rich.</hi> How ſtand theſe two together? they are not <hi>oppoſita,</hi> but <hi>ſubordinata,</hi> not <hi>oppoſites,</hi> but <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> the one to the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gods bleſſing</hi> makes rich, as the <hi>principal cauſe,</hi> and the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hand</hi> makes rich, as the <hi>inſtrumental cauſe</hi> under Gods bleſſing: there muſt be a wheel in the middle of a wheel, the wheel of <hi>diligence</hi> in the wheel of Gods <hi>bleſſing:</hi> there muſt be a hand in a hand, the hand of <hi>diligence</hi> in the hand of <hi>bleſſing:</hi> the diligent hand <hi>cannot</hi> make rich without Gods bleſſing, and Gods bleſſing <hi>will</hi> not make rich without a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hand. So they tempt God, that divide the <hi>ſpirit</hi> from the Ordinance; that look for <hi>Revelations</hi> and diſcoveries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Goſpel-ordinances;</hi> that look for <hi>grace</hi> without the <hi>Word;</hi> that look for light without the candle of the Miniſtry; that neglect <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> neglect <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and ſit at home and ſay, God will give them faith. Ah ye true <hi>Phanaticks!</hi> for <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God:</hi> the word <hi>cannot</hi> work grace without the ſpirit, the ſpirit ordinarily <hi>will not</hi> work grace without the word. So they tempt God, that look for <hi>God</hi> to ſubdue their ſins, and <hi>they</hi> do nothing; <hi>God</hi> muſt maſter their luſts, and unruly deſires, but <hi>themſelves</hi> will not ſtrive, nor faſt, nor pray, nor deny themſelves, nor wound their fleſh. As if an Army ſhould ſtand in <hi>Battalia</hi> againſt the Enemy, and not ſtrike one ſtroke; were not this a mad tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and horrid ſelf-murder? Up, ſirs, then, and your ſelves fight the good fight of faith againſt your luſts: <hi>Victory</hi> over ſin is a mercy which thou muſt come to, by thy <hi>own</hi> labour and co-operation: 'tis <hi>God</hi> indeed that hews down the ſtrong oaks of our luſts, but the <hi>Ax</hi> wherewith he doth it, muſt be in our hands: <hi>If ye through the ſpirit mortifie</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13.</note> 
               <hi>the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> So they tempt God, that will go in the way of means, but not far enough: many
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55699:123"/> will <hi>pray</hi> againſt ſin, but not <hi>practiſe</hi> againſt ſin: as if a ſick man ſhould pray for his health, but will take no <hi>phyſick</hi> for his health; or he that hath a dangerous wound ſhould pray to be healed, but will apply no <hi>plaiſter:</hi> they that <hi>pray</hi> for their children, but do not <hi>educate</hi> them, inſtruct, reprove, correct them, they tempt God, in that they do not uſe all the means; for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Fooliſhneſs is bound in the heart</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 15.</note> 
               <hi>of a child: but the rod of correction ſhall drive it far from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that argue, if we are <hi>elected,</hi> we ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> though we live <hi>as we liſt,</hi> and if we are <hi>not</hi> elected, we ſhall be <hi>damned,</hi> though we live never <hi>ſo holy,</hi> and endeavour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo carefully; theſe tempt God egregiouſly: for God elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the end, elects alſo to the means; hence that ſaying; [<hi>Praedeſtinatio eſt praeparatio gratiae in praeſenti, &amp; gloriae in futuro</hi>], Predeſtination is a preparation of grace for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and of glory for the future.</p>
            <p>And therefore, whereas thou ſayſt, If I am <hi>elected,</hi> I ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> though I live as I liſt, the <hi>inference</hi> is moſt falſe; for then,</p>
            <p>1. Converſion and Grace ſhould be commanded in vain, and becauſe predeſtination alone ſhould bring men to heaven; which is a fooliſh conceit, I ſay, predeſtination alone brings no man to Heaven; it is but the firſt link of the chain.</p>
            <p>2. Election or Predeſtination carrieth the <hi>means</hi> to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Womb of it; ſo that this conditional propoſition, though <hi>Paul</hi> continues a blaſphemer, yet by vertue of his Election, he ſhall be ſaved, is ſo far from being <hi>true,</hi> that the <hi>contrary</hi> ought to be inferred; if <hi>Paul</hi> be not converted, 'tis impoſſible he ſhould be ſaved, though elected, becauſe God who elected <hi>Paul</hi> to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> elected him to be ſaved by <hi>converſion,</hi> not by rebellion; by faith, not by unbelief.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayſt, if I am not elected, do what I can, live I never ſo holy, though I ſhould believe, and repent, I ſhall be <hi>damned</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>infallible</hi> decree.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: There was never any <hi>ſuch</hi> decree at all in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, of damning any man, though he believed and changed his life, and returned to God: I tell thee, there was never any ſuch Decree at all in the Divine Will, but the contrary, which God would have eſtabliſht for ever as moſt <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>certain;</hi> and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55699:124"/> promulged abroad to all men, That <hi>whoſoever believes, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life, and he that will have the ſon, ſhall have life.</hi> Oh comfort! unſpeakable comfort! and therefore come in, ſouls, come in and take Chriſt, <hi>ye ſinners,</hi> and fear not Reprobation, ye ſhall be ſaved. Sirs, let me in ſhort give ye a bleſſed word, fear <hi>ſin,</hi> and fear not <hi>reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> if ye fear ſin, reprobation can do ye no hurt.</p>
            <p>To conclude, as long as you remain <hi>unconverted,</hi> to preſume of your <hi>election, [Stultitiae eſt</hi>] it is <hi>folly;</hi> to affirm your <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, [Inſaniae eſt</hi>] it is <hi>madneſs:</hi> for this is to <hi>praedamn</hi> thy ſelf, or damn thy ſelf before-hand; that is, you cannot ſay, you are <hi>elect,</hi> till you are <hi>converted;</hi> to ſay, you are a reprobate, though yet unconverted, is to ſtop up your way (with your own hands) unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>To caſt our ſelves upon any <hi>immediate</hi> providence, when means <hi>fail not,</hi> is to tempt God, to <hi>diſobey</hi> inſtead of <hi>believing</hi> God: we may <hi>challenge</hi> God on his word, we may not <hi>ſtrain</hi> him beyond it Thus, <hi>Satan</hi> when he had ſet Chriſt upon the Pinacle of the Temple, bade him, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt</hi>

There were <hi>ſteps</hi> in the Temple, by which Chriſt might <hi>deſcend,</hi> and therefore needed not to tempt God, or put him to ſuch an Act of <hi>immediate</hi> Providence to preſerve him; we muſt not deſire God to give any extraordinary <hi>proofs</hi> of his <hi>care</hi> of us, when he hath provided the ordinary <hi>means</hi> for our <hi>ſafety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet let me tell you, that when all means ſeem to <hi>lye dead</hi> before us, then to caſt your ſelf upon <hi>immediate providence,</hi> for God to work, is no ſinful tempting of God; and therefore I ſaid, to caſt your ſelves upon any immediate providence, <hi>when means fail not,</hi> is to tempt God: but when all <hi>means</hi> have
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:55699:124"/> 
               <hi>left</hi> you, then to <hi>truſt</hi> God, and <hi>try</hi> what he will do, is no tempting of God: Did not <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> with the whole Church do ſo? <hi>We have no might againſt this great company:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron 20. 12.</note> 
               <hi>neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee;</hi> that is, to look and try what <hi>thou</hi> wilt do. Sirs, Is God tyed to <hi>means,</hi> or will you tye God to means? when means fail, will God fail his people?</p>
            <p>Yes, you'l ſay, in this very point lieth the caſe, for when all <hi>means</hi> are gone, and have left us, it is a ſign that <hi>God</hi> is leaving and giving over to help; for as means preſenting it ſelf, is a ſign of Gods <hi>Will</hi> to help, ſo when all means are gone, 'tis a ſign that God is <hi>giving over</hi> to help: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſit down, and leave off to act faith.</p>
            <p>This is indeed a rational arguing, according to <hi>nature,</hi> but not according to <hi>faith:</hi> and therefore let me tell you, you are quite miſtaken; for when death ſits upon the lips of the ſecond cauſe, and ſpeaks nothing but terror, then, even then, you are to believe, and put God to work for you: <hi>Although</hi>
               <note place="margin">Habbak. 3. 17. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall the fruit be in the vines, the labour of the olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtalls; yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation: The Lord God is my ſtrength, and he will make my feet like hindes feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.</hi> Here the Church believes, when all means are out of the way.</p>
            <p>This is no tempting of God, becauſe you have his promiſe: the <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> is the <hi>buckle</hi> and <hi>claſp</hi> fit for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; now the Lord do's not only promiſe to <hi>help</hi> his children, but he promiſes to help when all means <hi>fail: When the poor</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 41. 17, 18</note> 
               <hi>and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thirſt, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Iſrael will not forſake them: I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midſt of the valleys: I will make the wilderneſs a pool of water, and the dry-land ſprings of water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah, ye Chriſtians! that you would believe at this day: Will ye only believe when means are <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>have life</hi> in them? ye have read of the unbelief of the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were in the wilderneſs, they wanted ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and they murmured, and were full of unbelief, ſo that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:55699:125"/> the Lord was <hi>angry</hi> with them, and <hi>ſlew</hi> them, and they never came into the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> but I pray, what was their unbelief, for which God did ſlay them? was it this that they did not believe when they <hi>had</hi> means? No; but that they did not believe when all means <hi>failed,</hi> this was their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. You ſay you are afraid to believe, when you have no means, becauſe God hath commanded you to uſe the means: But know, I pray you,</p>
            <p>1. There is a time when God takes away the <hi>means</hi> to try our <hi>faith:</hi> And how doeſt thou know, whether this be not the day and the time? Thou ſayſt thou canſt not believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe means fail; it may be, it is the time of thy tryal, God ſends this time of purpoſe to try thee.</p>
            <p>2. God hath <hi>commanded</hi> you to uſe the means when you <hi>have</hi> them, but where hath God <hi>forbidden</hi> you to truſt in him when you have <hi>no</hi> means?</p>
            <p>2. God is tempted, when men are addicted too much to the means: as <hi>Thomas,</hi> when the diſciples told him, <hi>We have</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 20. 25.</note> 
               <hi>ſeen the Lord;</hi> ſaid he, <hi>except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not believe.</hi> What was this but to tempt Chriſt? Sirs, when we preſcribe God the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> the <hi>meaſure,</hi> then we tempt and try God.</p>
            <p>3. They tempt God, that uſe <hi>unlawful</hi> means; for all that<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu illicito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> own a <hi>God,</hi> will grant that all <hi>means</hi> work in vertue of the <hi>firſt cauſe,</hi> and can do nothing without a Divine Preſence, and therefore all expect Gods bleſſing in the uſe of means. We (ſay you) muſt uſe the means, and God muſt give the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and therefore when ye uſe <hi>unlawful</hi> means, ye tempt God to co-operate with means unlawful; you try him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will beſtow his concurrence with you in a way <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful;</hi> you prove him whether he will make his <hi>Providence</hi> go along with you in <hi>indirect</hi> means to ſerve your end: He that tells a <hi>lye</hi> to prevent a danger, or ſave his life, tempts God, and trys him to favour, and bleſs that lye unto his ſafety.</p>
            <p>4. Men tempt the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of God, when they make tryal, whether God is acquainted with things <hi>below,</hi> and knows what <hi>they</hi> are doing. When <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> ſold their<note place="margin">Acts 5. 9.</note> poſſeſſion, and kept back part of the price, ſaith <hi>Peter, How
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:55699:125"/> is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the ſpirit of the Lord?</hi> Whether theſe did purpoſely go about to tempt the Spirit, or no, is queſtioned; if ſo, then it was an <hi>intentional</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> tempting of the Spirit: However, though they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, yet 'twas an interpretative tempting of the Spirit, that is, it is called a tempting of the Spirit, and taken to be ſuch, becauſe it was ſuch a fact, as they could do no more, who had intended to tempt the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But how was the Spirit of God tempted in this Act of theirs? The act did tend, (though it may be, they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it), I ſay, the act did tend to this, to make a tryal, whether the Spirit <hi>knew</hi> their fraud, or not, and knowing of it, whether he would puniſh it: Their act ſpake in this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (as if themſelves had ſaid), Can it be, that the Spirit ſhould know or find out our deceit? And ſo the meaning of <hi>Peters</hi> words [<hi>How is it, that ye have agreed together to tempt the ſpirit of the Lord?</hi>] is this, How is it that ye have<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deodat.</hi> in loc.</note> agreed together to make a <hi>prophane tryal,</hi> whether he knew your fraud, or no? As if by this <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>fraudulent</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, you would try or make an experience whether the ſpirit were <hi>privy</hi> to your deceit, or no.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sirs, when men ſin in <hi>ſecret,</hi> they tempt Gods Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; it may be not of ſet-purpoſe, but their actions <hi>tend</hi> to it: Is Gods eye upon us? can we not ſin, but God muſt know it? can we be no-where out of his Preſence? Their actions behind the curtain, put God to the tryal, whether he ſeeth them, or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hypoorites</hi> tempt Gods Knowledg: they do (as it were) make a tryal, whether the <hi>beams</hi> of his Knowledg reach the <hi>dark center</hi> of their hearts, and his <hi>eyes</hi> read their <hi>cunning</hi> ends, and <hi>ſelf-deſigns:</hi> to play the Hypocrites, and carry on private Intereſts under the veil of profeſſion; what is it, but to try whether they cannot hide their plots from God?</p>
            <p>But oh fools! for, doth the influence of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> pierce down into the deep boſom of the earth, and there beget <hi>mettals</hi> and <hi>minerals,</hi> and ſhall not <hi>Gods Knowledg</hi> much more reach the heart of man? <hi>The Lord knows the thoughts</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 11.</note> 
               <hi>of man, that they are vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. They tempt God, who without <hi>a call</hi> caſt themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to danger, to make tryal whether God <hi>can,</hi> or <hi>will</hi> deliver
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55699:126"/> them. Scripture teacheth us, that when danger is upon us, we <hi>may</hi> hope well, relying on God for help; but we muſt not <hi>caſt</hi> our ſelves raſhly into danger, that God may help: we may truſt God in difficulties, that he <hi>will</hi> help, but we muſt not <hi>throw</hi> our ſelves into difficulties, expecting God <hi>to</hi> help. This was <hi>Satans</hi> method of tempting Chriſt, he would have had<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 5, 6.</note> Chriſt to caſt himſelf down from the Pinacle of the Temple, that is, throw himſelf into danger, and try whether God would not preſerve him, <hi>For it is written</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he ſhall</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up: leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> But ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> that is, by caſting thy ſelf without a call into danger: for Satan, though he <hi>alledged</hi> Scripture, yet <hi>hides</hi> ſome words which ſhew the meaning of it. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>He ſhall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways:</hi> and what are <hi>thy ways,</hi> but <hi>actions agreeable to thy calling, and thy duty?</hi> And thus he ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee <hi>in all thy ways,</hi> that is, in thoſe courſes that are appointed thee of God.</p>
            <p>But theſe words, <hi>To keep thee in all thy ways,</hi> the Devil leaves them out, and clips the ſentence, and therefore Chriſt tells him, <hi>It is written again, thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God;</hi> that is, by going out of our way, and caſting our ſelves into danger without a call, and then ſay the Lord will deliver us. It had been <hi>contrary</hi> to Chriſts <hi>way,</hi> and his <hi>duty,</hi> to have thrown himſelf down from the Pinnacle of the Temple: he had gone out of his way, had he done ſo.</p>
            <p>Sirs, when we go out of Gods <hi>precincts,</hi> we go out of Gods <hi>protection:</hi> a King undertakes the ſafety of his Subjects, whilſt they travel within <hi>due hours,</hi> and keep the Kings <hi>high-way,</hi> elſe not: ſo hath God promiſed to preſerve us, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to take charge over us, while we hold <hi>his</hi> way.</p>
            <p>If a man ſhould throw himſelf into a deep River, where in an ordinary way he could not but be drowned, and ſay, God is able to <hi>preſerve</hi> me, and make me <hi>ſwim out;</hi> you will ſay, he is a <hi>mad-man,</hi> his <hi>faith</hi> is <hi>frenzy,</hi> and 'tis a moſt horrid and prodigious tempting of God.</p>
            <p>So they tempt God, that engage themſelves to afflictions, to poverty, loſs of eſtate, without a call: and therefore they
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:55699:126"/> that <hi>ſuffer,</hi> muſt be ſure they have a <hi>good ground,</hi> and a <hi>good cauſe,</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of their ſide, elſe they ſinfully tempt God to provide for them.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I refer <hi>wilful</hi> and <hi>indiſcreet</hi> marriages: when perſons, neither of whom have any competent ſubſiſtence, ſhall marry together; they know not how to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>maintain</hi> themſelves, and yet ſay, <hi>God will provide,</hi> this is to tempt God: they caſt themſelves into the <hi>diſaſter</hi> of irremediable poverty, and into the <hi>deep gulph</hi> of a thouſand ſorrows and temptations, and yet ſay God will provide, what is this, but a <hi>ſottiſh</hi> and <hi>ſinful</hi> tempting of the Lord God? So they that expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>occaſions</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> of ſin, ſaying God will <hi>keep</hi> them from ſin, theſe tempt God.</p>
            <p>As ſervants that will venture to live in Papiſts houſes, and ſay, God will preſerve us from contagion, or when ſervants caſt themſelves into a <hi>prophane</hi> family, and ſay, God (I hope) will not ſuffer me to be the <hi>worſe</hi> for it, or when ſerious <hi>chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> ſhall make choice to tye themſelves in marriage to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi> and <hi>carnal</hi> perſons: or when a man ſhall engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>ſinful</hi> company, and ſay, Though <hi>they</hi> be naught, God will keep <hi>me,</hi> and take care of me, all theſe tempt God: as if a man ſhould throw himſelf into the fire, and ſay I ſhall not burn, God will keep me; or, as if a man ſhould run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an houſe where the plague is, and ſay, God will keep me from infection.</p>
            <p>6. God is tempted, when we are not ſatisfied with his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will,</hi> ſufficiently made known to us, but require fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments, and ſo put him to the tryal. And thus we may tempt God in point of <hi>Doctrine;</hi> when we will not ſit down content (I ſay) with the <hi>revealed will</hi> of God, when we refuſe to believe that which is teſtified to be his Will, but require more arguments thereof, as of a matter ſtill <hi>uncertain.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 15. 7.</note> When ſome Teachers would have impoſed Circumciſion upon the believing <hi>Gentiles, Peter</hi> argued againſt it:</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe God ſent him to Preach the Goſpel to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his Family, and others his Kinſmen and Friends, whom he had called together, all of them <hi>uncircumciſed</hi> Gentiles. God would have the Goſpel Preached to them, and they according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had, and received the faith, and yet were not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed: this was one argument, why they ſhould not be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
            <pb n="336" facs="tcp:55699:127"/>
            <p>2. God alſo (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) gave <hi>them the Holy Ghoſt, even</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> 
               <hi>as he did unto us: and by this, God which knoweth the hearts bare them witneſs;</hi> that is, by giving them the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> teſtified from heaven, that they were <hi>accepted</hi> of him, though they were not <hi>circumciſed;</hi> and therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Why tempt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> 
               <hi>ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples?</hi> Ye tempt God by urging Circumciſion upon them; that is, your lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that yoke on the <hi>Gentile-Chriſtians</hi> after ſuch evidences of Gods will to the contrary, is a tempting of God.</p>
            <p>Sinners, <hi>you</hi> thus tempt God, you tempt God, who believe not his <hi>clear dictates,</hi> but call into queſtion his <hi>certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi> God commands ye to be holy, and to walk ſtrictly and exactly; yet you doubt of it, whether it be ſo or no; you think you need not be ſo holy: though the Command revealed is clear as the Sun, yet you doubt whether God himſelf be ſo <hi>ſtrict,</hi> or whether his <hi>will</hi> is, that you ſhould walk by ſo ſtrict a rule; now you tempt God, and try him whether he made ſuch Commands <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> or in <hi>jeſt,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be in <hi>earneſt,</hi> or in <hi>ſport,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. They tempt God, that lay unneceſſary yokes upon the necks of the diſciples. As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Why tempt ye God, to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 15. 10.</note> 
               <hi>put a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deodate</hi> gives this gloſs upon it, Why do ye make a raſh tryal without any neceſſity or command, even with danger of ſiniſter ſucceſs, whether God will give them the will to ſubmit themſelves to a burthen ſo odious to them, and the power of bearing it, without being moved to impatience and revolt? arguing, that ſuch a courſe was to make the poor Gentile-Chriſtians to revolt from the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>8. Doubting hearts tempt the Lord, <hi>Can</hi> the Lord forgive? or <hi>will</hi> the Lord forgive ſuch a ſinner as I am? This comes to that paſs in the <hi>78th Pſalm.</hi> v. 18, 19. <hi>They tempted God in their heart, they ſaid, Can God furniſh a table in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi> Poor ſouls, let us pity one another: our doubting, is a tempting of God: let us then throw our ſelves upon his free promiſe, and fear nothing.</p>
            <p>9. Men may tempt God in holy duties.</p>
            <p>1. When we perform holy duties in our <hi>ſins:</hi> and here we tempt God [<hi>in exceſſu</hi>] in the exceſs, with too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence:
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55699:127"/> men will <hi>pray</hi> to God in their ſins, they will <hi>approach</hi> his Preſence, <hi>face</hi> him in duties, call him <hi>father,</hi> be <hi>bold</hi> with him in their addreſſes, come every day before him, and yet keep their <hi>ſins.</hi> Call him <hi>father,</hi> and yet <hi>hate</hi> the Saints; what an impudent tempting of God is this? they <hi>challenge</hi> him to be their God, and yet <hi>hate</hi> holineſs: they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>religious duties,</hi> and yet ſcorn at <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We tempt God in holy duties, by cold and indifferent performance. Sirs, conſider, oh conſider ſeriouſly, you <hi>pray,</hi> it may be, but you pray with <hi>ſlightneſs</hi> of heart; there is a certain <hi>wantonneſs,</hi> and <hi>trifling diſpoſition</hi> in the heart, that you are wont to be <hi>ſuperficial</hi> and <hi>imperfect</hi> in your ways: perhaps you will not leave off duties, but you do them; as if you did them not, without heart, in a looſe, lazy, formal, lifeleſs manner; now ye tempt God, both the <hi>majeſty</hi> and the <hi>mercy</hi> of God is deſpiſed: and can God be well-pleaſed with ſuch things? <hi>If ye offer the blind for ſacrifice, is it not evil?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and if ye offer the lame and ſick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governour;</hi> [that is, <hi>try</hi> him with ſuch a gift], <hi>and will he be pleaſed with thee, or accept thy perſon?</hi> No: he will not; ſhewing that when you offer ſuch gifts to God, you do but tempt him, and try his patience. It is an high preſumption, and temptation of God, to offer that to God, which we durſt not do to a ſuperiour mortal man; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duties to God with a ſlight heart, it is a ſlighting of God.</p>
            <p>3. A man tempts God in holy duties, when we do them to try God what he will do for us, in things of which we have <hi>no promiſe:</hi> as when men have tryed all ways and means of their own to be <hi>rich,</hi> and all will not do; now they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>religious,</hi> and ſet up duties in their families, to try this way alſo; if God will proſper them in the world, and give them of the dew of heaven, and the fatneſs of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: and here is a double ſin,</p>
            <p>1. In that they make <hi>Religion</hi> to ſerve the <hi>world,</hi> and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate <hi>Divine</hi> duties to <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>earthly</hi> ends: here <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is the <hi>means,</hi> and the <hi>world</hi> ſet up as the <hi>end:</hi> the <hi>end</hi> is always (in the intention of the <hi>agent</hi>) nobler than the <hi>means:</hi> they that worſhip God for the <hi>world,</hi> have an higher eſteem of the <hi>world,</hi> than they have of <hi>God</hi> or his <hi>worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They tempt God to give them outward things, which (it

            <p>10. They tempt God, who dare God, and try his patience, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 9. Neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of ſerpents. Neither let us tempt Chriſt,</hi> that is, let us not by our provoking ſins dare Chriſt, and try his patience, whether he will <hi>make good</hi> upon us his threats againſt ſin: when we go on in ſin, we make (as it were) undue tryals of his mercy and patience: to tempt God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> in locum.</note> is to make an experiment how far his patience will go, and how long it will endure and hold out.</p>
            <p>11. They tempt God, who try him whether he will not be <hi>better</hi> than his word: Sinners cannot deny, but the <hi>Word</hi> of God ſaith, <hi>Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor covetous, nor extortioners ſhall inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> They ſee this, they that are guilty of theſe ſins, ſee this, and cannot deny it; yet they <hi>hope,</hi> that though this be Gods word, yet he will be <hi>better</hi> than his word. We hope God will not be ſo <hi>ſtrict,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſevere</hi> as he ſaith; we truſt he will give a relaxation, and will not do all he ſaith in his word; if God will be as preciſe as his word, we are undone; if God will be no better than his word, wo to us.</p>
            <p>O ye tempters of God! how can ye be ſaved? I ſay, this is to tempt God, whether he be <hi>firm</hi> to his own word, or no; <hi>conſtant</hi> to his own ſayings, or no; this is, <hi>Facere Deum lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dionem &amp; ridiculum,</hi> I ſay, this is to make God a meer <hi>ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>player, ridiculous</hi> in his moſt <hi>grave</hi> tranſactions: What is this, but to make him <hi>light</hi> and <hi>unconſtant</hi> to his moſt <hi>ſolemn</hi> pronunciations?</p>
            <p>12. They tempt God, who live in <hi>known</hi> ſins againſt the manifeſt word of God; they make a tryal of him, whether he <hi>will</hi> puniſh them for their ſins, or no: whether he <hi>can</hi> be angry, or <hi>will</hi> be angry with ſin, or no: this is <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva tentatio,</hi> a tempting of God by Interpretation. Sirs, as oft as men ſin againſt their <hi>own conſciences,</hi> they do preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly tempt God, or try whether God will be <hi>juſt,</hi> or no; whether he be <hi>holy,</hi> or no: thou loveſt ſuch a ſin, and liveſt in it; now thou tempteſt God, whether <hi>he</hi> loves it and likes it alſo; and at length thou thinkeſt that God is ſuch a one as thy ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="339" facs="tcp:55699:129"/>
            <p>13. They tempt God, who attempt things above their parts and power, confiding in the Divine aſſiſtance, which is not promiſed them: thus many tempt God by entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Miniſtry; they undertake a great work, and are not underlaid with a ſtock of abilities, but they venture upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of Divine aſſiſtance: but where has God promiſed thee his aſſiſtance? he never promiſed his aſſiſtance to thoſe that are <hi>unable:</hi> he fits for the Miniſtry, but never promiſed aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the unfit.</p>
            <p>14. They that put off their repentance from the preſent to the <hi>future</hi>-time, and doubt not but God will give them grace and converſion whenſoever <hi>they liſt,</hi> tempt God exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. To repent, and turn to God, is a work above the ſphere of mans ability: who can change his own heart? Oh! but God will meet me with his aſſiſtance hereafter: poor man, Who told thee ſo? I am ſure <hi>God</hi> never did.</p>
            <p>15. They tempt God, who bring Gods Actions to the teſt and tryal; who ſubject his dealings to unjuſt examinations.</p>
            <p>16. To conclude. Some men tempt God to ſin, were he capable of ſuch a temptation. Indeed <hi>James</hi> ſaith of God,<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 13.</note> that he is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> is this. Oh let this point <hi>humble</hi> us: for who of us have not been <hi>tempters</hi> of the Lord, both in our days of unregeneracy, and ſince we gave up our names unto him; both in our days of unbelief, and ſince alſo in our days of faith?</p>
            <p>When we loved and lived in ſin, how did we continually tempt God, and ſince he manifeſted and revealed himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, how oft, how oft have we tempted him moſt unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and unfriendly? God may ſay to every one of us, <hi>You</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 14. 22.</note> 
               <hi>have tempted me theſe ten times:</hi> How have we indulged <hi>known</hi> ſins? and favoured <hi>ſecret</hi> luſts, and prayed free-grace to <hi>accept</hi> of us in our <hi>beloved</hi> ſins, and tryed his mercy to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us in our love to ſin againſt his <hi>revealed will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How coldly have we prayed againſt an <hi>endeared</hi> corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? nay have we not ſecretly prayed, oh! that God would <hi>ſpare</hi> me this ſweet ſin? oh! that God were of my
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55699:130"/> mind, that I might <hi>enjoy</hi> this pleaſing ſin: have we not at leaſt tacitly wooed God to a compliance with us! and how <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently</hi> have we conflicted with our pleaſing ſins, as if we were loth to over come them?</p>
            <p>How often have we tempted God with our impatience, our murmurings, our unbelief and diſcontents? How often in our afflictions have we called God to an account, brought his Actions to the teſt, and ſubjected his dealings to our unjuſt examinations? and tryed them by our touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. The <hi>ſecond <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Oh then let us take heed of this great ſin of tempting God: Sirs, you may <hi>truſt</hi> him, you may not <hi>tempt</hi> him: God by all his promiſes meant to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage your <hi>faith,</hi> not your <hi>preſumption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To tempt God, is a <hi>grieving</hi> of God: The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> brings in God ſpeaking thus to the Jews, <hi>When your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 95. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>tempted me, and proved me, and ſaw my works: Forty years long was I grieved with this generation.</hi> Tempting of God through unbelief, and not ſubmitting to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a <hi>vexing</hi> of his Spirit, and a provoking of him to reject the ſinner; <hi>Forty years long was I grieved with this</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> 
               <hi>generation—unto whom I ſware in my wrath, that they ſhould not enter into my reſt:</hi> They tempted God, and this grieved him, and vexed him, and then he ſware, they ſhould not enter his reſt.</p>
            <p>2. To tempt God, is a <hi>deſtroying</hi> ſin: <hi>Neither let us tempt</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of ſerpents.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. A <hi>laſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> ſhall be to give you ſome <hi>antidotes,</hi> and then I have done.</p>
            <p>1. You muſt get the clear eye of <hi>faith:</hi> by faith ſometimes we underſtand the promiſes; when we do not, the work of faith is to commit the ſoul to God, as unto a <hi>faithful creator:</hi> Faith will tell thee, when God <hi>frowns</hi> upon thee, he <hi>loves</hi> thee: Faith will help thee to commit thy ſoul unto God, <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions made way for him to heaven.</p>
            <p>2. Stay <hi>his leaſure,</hi> whatever your wants and conditions are, ſtay his leaſure, go not <hi>before</hi> God, ſtay his leaſure; if
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55699:130"/> thou wilt be but content to ſtay Gods <hi>leiſure,</hi> thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go out of the way: ſet faith and grace at work to help thee to look upon the time as <hi>ſhort:</hi> the mercy when it comes, will be infinitely ſweeter than if thou ſhouldſt pull it off with thine own hand: this will help thee to wait Gods leiſure.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Contentation</hi> is a rich antidote againſt tempting of God. The defect of this Contentation leads us into many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſins, both againſt <hi>God,</hi> while we murmur at his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>dealings</hi> with us.</p>
            <p>And againſt our <hi>neighbour,</hi> whoſe proſperous eſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better than <hi>ours,</hi> we envy at. And therefore, ſirs, if we have <hi>food</hi> and <hi>rayment,</hi> let us be therewith <hi>content,</hi> that we may not <hi>trouble</hi> the waters, nor diſquiet <hi>God</hi> nor our own <hi>ſouls.</hi>

            <p>The words are a Propoſition, <hi>Categorical</hi> and <hi>Affirmative;</hi> for they affirm that <hi>all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi> Where you have,</p>

            </p>
            <p>And the Propoſition is <hi>univerſal</hi> alſo, for it affirms that <hi>all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not diſcourſe of the <hi>Praedicate,</hi> or latter part of the Propoſition, namely, the Godly's ſuffering of perſecution, for this is a common Theam; and it is ſo true, even to our ſenſe and experience, that I need not ſpeak to it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore confine my ſelf to the <hi>Subject,</hi> or firſt part of the Propoſition, <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>]; becauſe I think it moſt concerns us to know what it is to be <hi>godly in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> for herein the Knowledg of our eternal intereſts lyeth: and if we can diſcern, that we are <hi>godly in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> we ſhall eaſily deduce our <hi>Title</hi> to Chriſt, and a <hi>Right</hi> to eternal glory in him.</p>

            <p>Yet, becauſe <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> requires the higheſt holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore carries a Divine <hi>Energy</hi> and virtue in it to ſupernatural actions, it conſiſts not in <hi>word</hi> only, but in <hi>power.</hi> No Religion ſanctifies, but this that is of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> what ſhe teacheth, ſhe <hi>infuſeth</hi> into the hearts of her Children; ſhe is <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> becauſe ſhe carries <hi>Chriſt</hi> in her; and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> came to <hi>reform</hi> and <hi>renew</hi> the world, to <hi>deſtroy</hi> ſin, and <hi>dethrone</hi> Satan, and bring down Heaven upon the Earth, and put <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> into an Unity again.</p>
            <p>2. Therefore this expreſſion [<hi>in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>] ſpeaks not only an <hi>outward profeſſion</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus, but alſo an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and an oneneſs with him: So that to be
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:55699:133"/> 
               <hi>godly in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is to be <hi>one</hi> with Chriſt Jeſus; for this is the high priviledg which Chriſtian Religion puts upon her true Diſciples, that Chriſt <hi>dwells</hi> in them, and they dwell in him. This is an high Divinity; they are united to Jeſus Chriſt, as the branch to the tree, the graft to the ſtock, the members to the head; and if united, then they muſt alſo be one with him, and by reaſon of this unity, do not only partake of his <hi>grace,</hi> but alſo his <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> in the ſame manner as we ſay, the members <hi>move</hi> not themſelves, nor <hi>live</hi> but by the life of their head. So that to live chriſtianly, it is not enough to ſay that we muſt be in <hi>grace,</hi> but we muſt live in the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of Jeſus: Foraſmuch as we are <hi>one</hi> with Chriſt, we muſt live <hi>his</hi> life, and be acted and guided by <hi>his</hi> Spirit. That life of Union which makes us <hi>one</hi> with him, cauſes us to live in his ſpirit and life. <hi>Not I, but Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
               <hi>lives in me:</hi> And therefore the life of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> is the life of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, who lives in us by his <hi>Son.</hi> Whence it follows, that as the <hi>Father</hi> lives in the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> in the <hi>Father;</hi> ſo <hi>we</hi> live in Jeſus, and <hi>Jeſus</hi> in us: and becauſe <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> lives in us, the <hi>Father</hi> alſo lives in us; as you may find in <hi>Job. 14. 23. If any man love me, he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This expreſſion [<hi>in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>] ſpeaks <hi>cauſality;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>all that live godly,</hi> are <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the <hi>effect</hi> in its <hi>cauſe,</hi> they have all their Being of <hi>grace</hi> from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> I ſay, they are in Chriſt, as the effect in its cauſe.</p>
            <p>They are in Chriſt Jeſus, as</p>
            <p>1. In the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe.</p>
            <p>2. In the <hi>exemplary</hi> cauſe.</p>
            <p>3. In the <hi>conſerving</hi> and <hi>ſupporting</hi> cauſe of all their <hi>graces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. They muſt be in Chriſt as in the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of all their graces. For God in giving us Chriſt in our nature, makes him thereby the principle of a <hi>new life</hi> in us, and wills, that as <hi>himſelf</hi> is the principle of the life of his Son in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal generation; ſo his <hi>Son</hi> ſhould be the principle of our life in the new Regeneration of our ſouls, <hi>with the waſhing of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 26. John 5. 21.</note> 
               <hi>water by the word. As the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickneth them, even ſo the Son quickneth whom he will,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55699:134"/> dead in their graves, or dead in their ſins. And again, <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given the Son to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 26.</note> 
               <hi>have life in himſelf:</hi> i. e. to give life to others.</p>
            <p>2. The godly are <hi>in Chriſt</hi> as their <hi>exemplary cauſe.</hi> They form up themſelves to him. Men cannot be <hi>godly,</hi> unleſs they make <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Samplar; ſo that to <hi>live godly in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> is to <hi>act</hi> and <hi>live</hi> like unto Jeſus Chriſt, to make <hi>him</hi> the <hi>Idaea</hi> of our graces, and the <hi>partern</hi> of our life. All that wear the name of <hi>godly</hi> upon them, are obliged to <hi>imitate</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: The greateſt honour we can give him, is to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> our ſelves to his life and intentions; to imitate Jeſus Chriſt, maintains our adherence to him. I beſeech you, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, we <hi>adhere</hi> no longer to Chriſt, than we are <hi>like</hi> him, and we are not <hi>in</hi> him, if we do not imitate him.</p>
            <p>Our life then muſt be a lively Image of the life of Jeſus Chriſt. The firſt uſe a Chriſtian is to make, is to look upon the Son of God as the <hi>Prototype</hi> and <hi>Exemplar</hi> of his life and actions, to expreſs and repreſent him (as it were) <hi>to the life.</hi> As the <hi>Son</hi> of God is the Image and Reſemblance of his <hi>Father,</hi> ſo muſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> be of the Son. <hi>We</hi> muſt be by <hi>grace,</hi> what <hi>Jeſus</hi> is by <hi>nature:</hi> the Son of God is the true life, and true model of <hi>our</hi> life.</p>
            <p>Our interior and exterior life then muſt imitate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the exerciſes of the ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt, and the actions of his ſacred life.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in another caſe. <hi>As we have born the</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 49.</note> 
               <hi>image of the earthly [Adam], ſo ſhall we alſo bear the image of the heavenly,</hi> i. e. of Chriſts glory; when we come to glory; ſo as we have born the Image of <hi>Adam,</hi> imitating him by ſin, and following him by our own inclinations, we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bear the Image of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> copying out his life and actions.</p>
            <p>God gave us a Law as a Rule of life; but he gives us a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Law,</hi> a living Rule, and form of life in Chriſt, and ſhews us <hi>in him</hi> the manner of converſation that we muſt follow, to live chriſtianly, that is, to live a <hi>new life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Beloved,</hi> we ſhould never have underſtood the <hi>dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of life, as it lyeth in the <hi>law,</hi> had we not ſeen it acted in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> By looking on, and taking ſome meaſure of the excellent life of Jeſus Chriſt, we come to know what
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:55699:134"/> the life of holineſs is, that is commanded in the law.</p>
            <p>And, obſerve it, The Lord Chriſt came not only to ſet himſelf before us to imitate him, but to give us a <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to imitate him, and put on his likeneſs: As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider it ſeriouſly, Many becauſe they lean upon Chriſt for pardon, and upon his righteouſneſs alone for ſalvation, believe luſtily, that they are in Chriſt Jeſus. But ye are not <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, till ye live <hi>his</hi> life; your <hi>vital imitation</hi> of Chriſt, ſpeaks your <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> to Chriſt; if you are not <hi>like</hi> him, you do not <hi>live</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>To imitate Chriſt,</p>
            <p>1. We muſt ſhun all manner of <hi>ſin; for he knew no ſin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21. 1 Pet. 2. 22.</note> And again, 'tis ſaid of him, <hi>Who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> And 'tis ſaid there, <hi>That he left us an</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 21.</note> 
               <hi>example, that ye ſhould follow his ſteps, who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> So then here lies our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, that as he had no ſin, ſo we muſt <hi>ſtrive</hi> to have no ſin in us. And, <hi>my Beloved,</hi> to what end are we reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and pray, and put on a devout form upon our ſelves, if we favour our ſins in us? To pray againſt ſin, and yet indulge ſin us, is to play the greateſt hypocrites: to pray like Chriſt, and not live like Chriſt, is the rankeſt diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>And that you may put your ſelves into a <hi>perfect</hi> reſemblance of Jeſus Chriſt, you muſt mortifie <hi>nature</hi> in you; for Chriſt was pure in his <hi>nature,</hi> he was not only free from <hi>acts</hi> of ſin, but had an <hi>unſtained nature:</hi> and therefore to be like Chriſt, you muſt get all ſtains of ſin out of your nature; you moſt mortifie the Spirit and Inclinations of <hi>Adam</hi> in you; you muſt root out of the foundation of your ſoul, I ſay, you muſt put out of the very foundation of your Being, all hidden principles, all oppoſitions, inclinations and cuſtoms contrary to holineſs.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Mortification</hi> (which is in a manner loſt among Chriſtians) muſt be both <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>outward,</hi> nay chiefly of the <hi>inward man.</hi> The keen edg of Mortification muſt fall directly upon the root, the nature of man, the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> in us.</p>
            <p>And therefore, though to abſtain from <hi>groſs ſins,</hi> makes a
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:55699:135"/> fair and goodly ſhew in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> yet 'tis inſignificant, and ſtands for nothing before <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> without the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spiritual</hi> ſins are the ſouls poyſon, the ſouls death: and there is no <hi>carnal</hi> ſin could reign in us, were it not held up by ſome <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſin: ſpiritual ſin is the root upon which all carnal ſins grow. Spiritual ſins are the <hi>Devils</hi> ſins, he cannot act bodily and fleſhly ſins; he can be no drunkard, nor adulterer; he is a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and ſins as a ſpirit: ſo are thoſe ſins we ſpeak of, proper to the ſouls nature that is a ſpirit; as ſelf-love, hatred of God, Idolatry, error in the mind and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, admiring of our ſelves, ſeeking our own glory, pride, unbelief, fears, cares, deſires.</p>
            <p>Theſe are <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſſes,</hi> by theſe are we ſet fartheſt from God; nay by theſe we become <hi>Anti-Gods,</hi> and are the very <hi>pictures</hi> of the <hi>Devil;</hi> he cannot be a drunkard, or adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, but he can be proud, and envious, and malicious, and contentious, and ſelf-ſeeking, and vain-glorious, and in theſe <hi>we</hi> play the <hi>Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore I ſay, our Mortification muſt be inward, it muſt fall upon our inward and ſpiritual man of ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us.</p>
            <p>And therefore by <hi>Mortification</hi> we underſtand not only <hi>corporal auſterities,</hi> ſuch as affect the ſenſe, as <hi>macerations, faſtings,</hi> and other <hi>external exerciſes,</hi> which rob the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of what is moſt agreeable to it, which though they be <hi>good,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>neceſſary,</hi> yet are not the <hi>principal;</hi> but we intend (I ſay) <hi>inward Mortification,</hi> whereby a man <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> his heart, <hi>annihilates</hi> the ſources within, <hi>drys</hi> up the fountains, and <hi>pulls up</hi> the inward roots of vice; he dyes to himſelf, kills the ſeeds of ſelf-love, though hid in every thing, gets victory over <hi>himſelf</hi> and his inclinations; his principal care is to annihilate his reaſon, and underſtanding, his will, his intentions, his deſires, his propenſities, as far as they are corrupted, chuſing in all things that which is moſt pure.</p>
            <p>And now he becomes moſt <hi>conformable</hi> to the ſpirit and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore to this he wholly addicts himſelf; herein he is very vigilant, he knows it generally as a <hi>maxim,</hi> that the more the heart of man is filled with the <hi>creatures,</hi> and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:55699:135"/> the love and regard of <hi>himſelf,</hi> the more he is ſeparated from <hi>God,</hi> void of his <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>true virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To imitate <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>not</hi> only to do what is <hi>good,</hi> but to do it in the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Men <hi>will</hi> be doing good actions, they cannot help it, they have ſo much light, and are ſo inwardly convinced; but we muſt remember that our actions muſt be ſo done, as to be <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and worthy the Son of God. They muſt be holy, and to be holy, they muſt be accompliſh'd in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and by the <hi>principle</hi> of grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of Jeſus. Our actions, to be Chriſtian, muſt be done in the ſpirit and diſpoſition of Jeſus Chriſt; that is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt do them in us, the ſpirit of Chriſt muſt act them in us: we muſt do all with the very heart of Jeſus Chriſt; you know all our good actions are nothing without the heart, <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart.</hi> Now the heart from which we do them, muſt be the very heart of Chriſt in us. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> gives witneſs of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <hi>God is my Record, how greatly I long after you all, in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So, if you reprove ſinners, if you tell others their faults, if you do works of mercy, you muſt do all in the <hi>bowels of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, it is not enough barely to do what the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath done; we may deceive our ſelves herein, believing we do much when we do nothing of value; becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> being <hi>man</hi> as we are, and converſing among them, no doubt but we may find ſome conformity and reſemblance to him, even among the wicked in the common ſtates of men. Many ſuffer, and are oppreſſed, many poor and humbled, many ſequeſter themſelves from the pomp of the Court, and live in the obſcurity of a retired life; many faſt and pray, and do almoſt all the outward actions, that the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> did upon the earth. <hi>He</hi> was man as we are, <hi>we</hi> are men as he was; <hi>he</hi> did good, <hi>we</hi> do <hi>ſome</hi> good; this is no imitation of him.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe it is not enough to do what he did; but we muſt do it with the ſpirit, in the diſpoſition, and by the ſacred principle that he operates. This few perſons mind: it is not enough to do, but we muſt do it by a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace, not of general grace (compriſed under the common name we give to all the gifts of God), but of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:55699:136"/> grace which gives us Chriſt, communicates to us his ſpirit, and puts us into the holy diſpoſition of his ſoul; and doing all things by <hi>this</hi> principle, we imitate the Son of God, ſo far, that our natural and common actions are withdrawn from their meanneſs, and are of great account with God, as being operated by the ſame principle, and with the ſame diſpoſitions of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Herein appears the great difference between <hi>Chriſtian virtues,</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>humane.</hi> A man that hath <hi>refined prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> and perfections, and acts according to them, may be called <hi>good;</hi> but a man that <hi>is in Chriſt, is a new creature,</hi> and hath <hi>another</hi> goodneſs, a <hi>new</hi> goodneſs, and his actions are conformable to this <hi>new Being</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> To difference <hi>Chriſtian</hi> virtues from <hi>Moral,</hi> we muſt be one with Chriſt, and conſequently muſt not operate but with him; for this cauſe he gives us his ſpirit whereby we act, or he acts in us. It follows, they are not ſo much our virtues, our graces, as theſe of <hi>Jeſus in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſpirit and diſpoſition of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in all his ſervices looked upon the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Father: I ſeek</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 5. 30. John 6. 38. John 8. 49, 50. John 7. 18.</note> 
               <hi>not mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me. I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> And again, <hi>I honour my father, I ſeek not mine own glory: He that ſpeaketh of himſelf, ſeeketh his own glory: but he that ſeeketh his glory that ſent him,</hi> [as Chriſt did] <hi>the ſame is true, and no unrighteouſneſs is in him.</hi> You ſee what Chriſt aimed at, and which way his ſpirit and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition looked out, in all his actions <hi>the will</hi> of his Father, the glory of his Father; and in purſuit of that doth what is moſt contrary to his own intereſts, conceals nothing, though it coſt him never ſo dear to declare it: his Fathers honour only ſate upon his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Now if you would truly and rightly imitate <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> you muſt not only be found doing good, but you muſt do it in the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. Thou muſt not honour thy ſelf, nor ſeek it from others; you muſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your own advantages, ſomewhat of glory or profit to your ſelves, but labour only the bringing honour to God. If we imitate Chriſt, Jeſus Chriſt doth all in us, <hi>acting</hi> and referring all our actions to the glory of his Father, as <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:55699:136"/> did; ſo muſt the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> his <hi>center</hi> muſt be the boſom of God, all his actions and ſufferings muſt be pure, and referred to the glory of God; his intentions muſt look only upon God, his deſires muſt be only to pleaſe God, his care only to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God, his contentment wholly in God. Thus, I ſay, his thoughts, his deſigns, his works muſt bear the Image of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; he muſt do all of God, all to God, and all for God.</p>
            <p>3. We muſt imitate Jeſus Chriſt in ſelf-denial.</p>
            <p>4. We muſt imitate Jeſus Chriſt in accepting humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſufferings. <hi>If any man will be my diſciple, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs and follow me.</hi> The Apoſtle alſo, who is but the <hi>eccho</hi> of Chriſt, reſounds the ſame leſſon, when he ſaith, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered for us,</hi> [and that<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 21.</note> we muſt imitate him] <hi>leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> After this ſurely we cannot in reaſon find any thing <hi>hard;</hi> for if Chriſt from his <hi>birth</hi> to his <hi>death</hi> hath <hi>eſpouſed</hi> ſufferings, and <hi>embraced</hi> the croſs: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould we refuſe [being his <hi>Children</hi>] to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> as he did? For as the Chriſtian muſt be the Image of Chriſt, ſo he muſt bear with Jeſus Chriſt all ſorts of commotions, and pains, humiliations and ſufferings, that our life may be an expreſs Image of his life, which appeared always in deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, lowneſs, and ſufferings; ſo ours muſt be but the ſame ſtate of ſufferings, when he calls us thereunto.</p>
            <p>5. Imitate Jeſus Chriſt in love: the love of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> muſt be the ſame with that of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Herein appears the great difference between <hi>Chriſtian</hi> vertues, and <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Humane.</hi> For inſtance,</p>
            <p>The love that God requires of a Chriſtian, muſt not be,</p>
            <p>1. That of a <hi>Pagan,</hi> who loves them that love him.</p>
            <p>2. Nor that of a <hi>Politician,</hi> who loves according to his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> or <hi>intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Nor that of a <hi>Jew,</hi> who loves not but out of an <hi>hope</hi> of reward promiſed, or a <hi>fear</hi> of judgments.</p>
            <p>The love of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> muſt be the ſame with that of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, he muſt love with the ſame love wherewith Jeſus loves; he muſt love with the love of Jeſus, as he muſt live the life of Jeſus. <hi>Walk in love, as Jeſus Chriſt hath</hi>

               <hi>loved you: I give you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>a new Commandment, that ye love one another, AS I HA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E LO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ED YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> To love is no <hi>new Commandment,</hi> this law was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in our hearts from the beginning of the world; but the <hi>manner of loving is new,</hi> that is, to love by the <hi>ſame love</hi> wherewith <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved us. Now thus muſt we love, we muſt love with a <hi>new love,</hi> the <hi>new love</hi> of Jeſus hath made it a <hi>new Commandment.</hi> Oh! how great is this love! how pure! how free from all ſelf-intereſt! how ſtrong and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, ſince it is the ſame love that made Jeſus to be <hi>born,</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> for us, even then when we were his enemies, and ſin reigning in us!</p>
            <p>And therefore we muſt love our enemies, with the love of Jeſus Chriſt: we muſt love our enemies with the ſame love, wherewith Chriſt loved us when we were his enemies. And therefore we muſt pray for enemies, for ſo did Chriſt for his: <hi>Father forgive them;</hi> ſo did <hi>Steven, Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Chriſtians are in Chriſt Jeſus, as in the <hi>conſerving</hi> and <hi>ſupporting cauſe</hi> of their graces. The Saint is in Chriſt much like as the <hi>accident</hi> is in its <hi>ſubject,</hi> for as [<hi>Accidentis eſſe eſt ineſſe</hi>], the <hi>Being</hi> of an accident, conſiſts in its being in the <hi>Subject;</hi> ſo the very being of a Chriſtian lyeth in his being in Chriſt; <hi>he</hi> lives, and his graces live, while he is in Chriſt; he is loſt, and all his graces are loſt, if he be once ſeparated from Chriſt: <hi>Abide in me, and I in you; as the branch</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 15. 4.</note> 
               <hi>cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sirs, Are ye in Chriſt? be ſure you keep in him then, for <hi>out of him</hi> ye dye and give up the ghoſt; as the fiſh dyes out of the water, and the coal dyes out of the fire, ſo grace dyes and expires out of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>4. This expreſſion [<hi>In Chriſt Jeſus, [All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>] ſpeaks ſubjection to Chriſt. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, but we muſt be in him as our <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Sovereign;</hi> we are in him [as <hi>Regnum in Rege</hi>] as the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> is in a <hi>King,</hi> that is, in the <hi>Power</hi> of a King, and as the members are in the head, under its <hi>Regency,</hi> to be ruled by its <hi>Influence</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> ſo are we in Chriſt: we are <hi>in</hi> him, that we may be <hi>under</hi> him, to be ruled and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:55699:137"/> guided by him. The <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>infinite rights</hi> to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> and we have <hi>infinite obligations</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> which the <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> of our days will not give us leave ſufficiently to admire, nor the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of our ſpirits to comprehend.</p>
            <p>The law of ſubjection to Chriſt is <hi>fundamental,</hi> and belongs to the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of Gods ſpiritual Kingdom: for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the very eſſence of it, is an order of <hi>ſuperiority</hi> and <hi>ſubjection;</hi> the conſtitution of government lyes in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>perſon</hi> that ſhall govern, and the <hi>parties</hi> that ſhall be governed: ſo the conſtitution of this Divine and Spiritual Kingdom of God is in his appointment of the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>Subjection</hi> of Man to him. <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> are the <hi>eſſential</hi> or <hi>integral</hi> parts which give eſſence to government, and conſtitute its being and exiſtence: to <hi>obey</hi> is the eſſence of Subjects: this ſubjection is the very eſſence of the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſo of the <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our ſubjection to Chriſt conſiſts,</p>
            <p>1. In an act of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Adoration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In an act of <hi>Oblation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In an <hi>act of honour</hi> and <hi>adoration.</hi> The <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is infinitely adorable, and we are <hi>obliged</hi> to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and adore him with ſo much <hi>neceſſity,</hi> that the very <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Damned</hi> are forced in ſome way to do it. To form this <hi>Act,</hi> we muſt acknowledg Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> we muſt regard him as our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> as the <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of all our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; we muſt annihilate our ſelves before him, and humble our ſelves even to the bottom of our ſouls; we muſt accept him as our <hi>God, King,</hi> and <hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another act of ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt, is an <hi>act of Oblation;</hi> whereby the ſoul offers her ſelf wholly to Jeſus Chriſt, and renouncing <hi>her ſelf,</hi> reſigns into his hand all that ſhe is, all the power that ſhe hath over her ſelf, over all her actions, over all things; and to make her ſelf more the ſervant to Jeſus in a perfect condition, ſhe renounceth her own <hi>liberty,</hi> and all the uſe ſhe can make thereof, giving it up into the hands of the Son of God, of whom ſhe received it, granting him all the right that he had to diſpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to order it as <hi>he</hi> pleaſeth; that being ſo reſigned to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſhe may not <hi>have</hi> any thing more, nor <hi>be</hi> any thing
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:55699:138"/> more, but that <hi>he</hi> may <hi>be</hi> all, <hi>have</hi> all, and <hi>operate</hi> all in her. This act puts the ſoul into a <hi>perfect denudation,</hi> and makes her entirely <hi>dependent</hi> upon Chriſt to be led according to <hi>his</hi> will.</p>
            <p>1. Let us then acknowledg the Soveraignty of <hi>Jeſus</hi> over all creatures, and over us in particular. Confeſſing that he is our King and Soveraign; let us adore his Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: it is <hi>life</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> to <hi>know</hi> and to <hi>ſerve</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Let us ſubmit actually to his Power, not out of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi> or <hi>neceſſity,</hi> as rebels, or ſlaves, but out of <hi>choice, love,</hi> and <hi>fidelity,</hi> as our <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Chriſtian in this ſtate looks upon himſelf only as a <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> to Jeſus, and acts in all things only in the ſpirit of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> and <hi>ſubjection</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>This ſtate of ſervice is <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in regard of God: the creature is eſſentially depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſubject to the Creator. It is an indiſpenſable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, the creature may as ſoon ceaſe to <hi>be,</hi> as ceaſe to <hi>depend on,</hi> and be <hi>ſubject</hi> to the Creator.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>eſſential</hi> alſo unto all <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> the firſt ſtep of our entry into the <hi>Church,</hi> and into <hi>Faith,</hi> the firſt <hi>operation</hi> of grace upon our ſouls, is to become ſervants to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This ſubjection is the <hi>firſt promiſe</hi> we make to God by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn publick profeſſion in the Church by <hi>baptiſm;</hi> there we devote our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, to belong to him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him, and we enter our ſelves into the ſtate of <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> and vow our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt as ſuch. So that by one and the ſame <hi>ſacrament,</hi> we are made the <hi>Children</hi> of God, and received his <hi>ſervants;</hi> and conſequently we are in the houſe of God, both as <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Servants;</hi> yet ſo, as that we are his <hi>Children</hi> by <hi>grace,</hi> his <hi>Servants</hi> by <hi>nature.</hi> The ſtate of ſubjection is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the Creature, and to the Chriſtian; ſo the ſame ſtate is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the <hi>Piety</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and a <hi>godly life;</hi> and therefore they who would eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh themſelves in Piety or Godlineſs, muſt begin their eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in this ſubjection, for we muſt bear a relation of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, as we do of <hi>purchaſe</hi> and <hi>neceſſity;</hi> we are ſo much the more <hi>Gods,</hi> and conſequently the more <hi>perfect,</hi> by how much we are the more <hi>abaſed</hi>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:55699:138"/> and <hi>deveſted</hi> of our ſelves, entirely depending, and faithfully operating under the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of him, who makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>ours,</hi> that we may be <hi>his;</hi> and hath purchaſed us to himſelf at an ineſtimable rate.</p>
            <p>In three points the ſoul of ſolid <hi>Piety,</hi> and the perfection of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> conſiſts,</p>
            <p>1. That we are united to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as our head, and we his members.</p>
            <p>2. That in this Union we live by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>3. And follow his motions.</p>
            <p>The ſoul then muſt reſign and offer up to Chriſt her heart and will, her underſtanding and power, to the wiſdom, will, and power of Jeſus Chriſt in all matters of eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This reſignation is the root and ground of all obedience and ſervice; by it we renounce all other Powers, Lords, Maſters, Teachers, Redeemers, and eſpecially the <hi>Devil, World,</hi> and <hi>Fleſh,</hi> ſo as to account <hi>them</hi> our <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſeeing the perſon ſubmitting is a <hi>guilty</hi> perſon, this reſignation cannot be performed without an inward acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his own ſin, guilt, baſeneſs, miſery, with godly ſorrow; a deteſtation of ſin, and a returning to obedience again. And being guilty perſons, impotent and unable to help our ſelves; in this reſignation we renounce all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our ſelves and all other things, ſo as wholly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye upon <hi>Gods mercy,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts merit,</hi> as without which we muſt periſh everlaſtingly, which ſo works upon us, that by ſubjection we do <hi>gladly</hi> and <hi>willingly</hi> bind our ſelves to be his perpetual <hi>ſervants</hi> and <hi>vaſſals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore as according to law, the <hi>ſlave</hi> is no more his <hi>own,</hi> nor hath <hi>any right</hi> over any thing, but is wholly left to the power and pleaſure of his <hi>maſter;</hi> ſo by this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> puts himſelf as nothing before Jeſus Chriſt; he gives place to all his rights of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> to be <hi>only</hi> the ſubject of Chriſts Power and Divine Will.</p>
            <p>And though we are all <hi>ſervants</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt by <hi>right</hi> and <hi>purchaſe,</hi> (as we ſaid before), yet we will <hi>be</hi> ſuch alſo out of <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>affection,</hi> giving him a <hi>new power</hi> over
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:55699:139"/> us, <hi>i. e.</hi> by our own <hi>voluntary conſent,</hi> and <hi>free choice,</hi> to be ſo, that we may be <hi>Captives</hi> to his <hi>love,</hi> as well as to his <hi>Power,</hi> and ſubmit to the <hi>deſigns</hi> of the <hi>eternal Father,</hi> who<note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> did ſo graciouſly <hi>deliver us from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated us into the kingdom of his dear ſon.</hi> This, this it is to be in Chriſt, to be in Chriſt, is to be in this ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>My Beloved,</hi> we who ſay, we have taken Chriſt, and are in ſubjection to him, let us weigh well what we ſay, and conſider with what ſincerity and faithfulneſs we deal with the Son of God. For ſeeing that we <hi>avouch</hi> that we leave our ſelves wholly to him in the quality of <hi>ſervants,</hi> and make profeſſion to have nothing which is not his, and of him; and that we yield up all to him, even to the uſe of our own life and <hi>natural liberty:</hi> What have we more to think of, but ſincerely and faithfully to <hi>accompliſh</hi> what we <hi>profeſs?</hi> What have we more to do, but to make our life <hi>conformable</hi> to what we ſay? <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>ſubject</hi> our ſelves in will and deed to the Greatneſs and Soveraignty of Jeſus Chriſt: I ſay, <hi>in will and deed,</hi> for it would avail but little, to ſay it only with the mouth, and have it in the thought, if all our actions be full of our own will; I ſay, it were to little purpoſe to ſubject our ſelves by <hi>words</hi> to the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, to the <hi>conduct</hi> of his Spirit and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> if in the management of our life we follow the Spirit of the <hi>World,</hi> and live in a continual deſire to ſatisfie our ſelves and our own inclinations. Let us mind this, becauſe ſo many <hi>deceive</hi> themſelves in the <hi>godly life,</hi> which they ſo eaſily profeſs, contenting themſelves with the <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> and eglect the reſt.</p>
            <p>Remember that he, who ſays, we muſt adore God in <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> ſaid alſo, we muſt adore him in <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. This expreſſion <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus [All that will live god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>] ſpeaks the <hi>end</hi> of a <hi>godly life:</hi> Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the end of a godly life: they that live <hi>in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, do live <hi>to</hi> Chriſt Jeſus: to live in Chriſt Jeſus, is not only to live by the <hi>virtue</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo to the <hi>glory</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, to ſeek <hi>his</hi> praiſe, and to have <hi>his</hi> honour in our eye: the <hi>godly life</hi> is not only <hi>from</hi> Chriſt, but <hi>for</hi>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:55699:139"/> Chriſt. And therefore they that <hi>live godly in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> they <hi>derive</hi> it <hi>from</hi> him, and <hi>direct</hi> it <hi>to</hi> him; they breath for him, and bring forth all their actions for him: for this is eſſential to an Evangelical life, to do all in the ſtrength of Chriſt as their <hi>root,</hi> and to do all for Chriſt as their <hi>end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this be a <hi>godly life,</hi> to live to Chriſt; then let us ſo think of him, and ſo do, that from henceforth our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>mouths</hi> may neither <hi>ſpeak</hi> nor <hi>think,</hi> but of him; that all things elſe may be of no ſavour to us, that nothing enter our ſpirit, which <hi>reſenteth</hi> not the Spirit and Odour of Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>reſpires</hi> not his honour and glory. I ſay, let us be vigilant and faithful to <hi>do</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> nothing but the honour of Chriſt, to regard nothing but his pleaſure and glory, ſo as to have no eyes but for Jeſus; no more life, but what is conſecrated to the honour of his Soveraignty and Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> We have ſhewed you what a godly life is, and how you may attain a godly life. Let us now ſtir you up to attain this godly life.</p>
            <p>1. Let me take St. <hi>Pauls</hi> word to <hi>Timothy:</hi> that which he recommends to him, is, <hi>Piety; Exerciſe thy ſelf unto god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Truly all <hi>virtues</hi> are <hi>good,</hi> and all <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the ſtate of a Chriſtian, the <hi>acquiſition</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> of them all <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>neceſſary;</hi> but he would have his <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> care be, <hi>To exerciſe thy ſelf unto godlineſs:</hi> for <hi>godlineſs</hi> is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and Miſtreſs of all other <hi>virtues;</hi> it leads us to God, and makes uſe of all <hi>virtues</hi> to conduct us thither; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Object but God, teaches us the worſhip and honour that we muſt render to him, and like a <hi>good miſtreſs,</hi> puts us into a ready and eaſie practiſe of virtues, and entertains us in the exerciſe of actions that honour God, and are acceptable to him.</p>
            <p>2. Godlineſs is profitable: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the ſame place, <hi>Bodily exerciſe profiteth little, but godlineſs is profitable to all</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="360" facs="tcp:55699:140"/>
            <p>
               <hi>True godlineſs</hi> is one of the principal foundations on which <hi>Chriſtian perfection</hi> ſtands, and is ſupported. In the conduct of men all actions and exerciſes of their life are ruled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Piety,</hi> and (as we commonly ſay) according to the <hi>Devotion</hi> they have. If their Piety be not <hi>well-laid,</hi> the reſt of the Chriſtian life will be <hi>unconſtant,</hi> and its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes very <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>ſuperficial;</hi> as we ſee in the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many, which is only in the exterior, <hi>Who</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith) <hi>having the form of godlineſs, deny</hi> [and deſpiſe] <hi>the power thereof.</hi> In ſuch ſouls we ſee nothing ſolid, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but inconſtancy in their lives, imperfection in their actions, diſquiet, diſturbance, and adherence to ſeveral crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their ſpirits; a ſmall blaſt of adverſity over-turns them.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But it is an hard thing to be godly: we have Satan oppoſing us, and he is too hard for us, beſides our own corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſtrong temptations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> While we ſtrive to be <hi>godly,</hi> we may ſafely expect the <hi>Preſence</hi> of God: he is never wanting to thoſe that ſeek after him, and never fails thoſe that engage in his <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels.</hi> As he who <hi>plots</hi> ſin, ſhall be ſure to find <hi>Satan</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his right hand; ſo he that <hi>purſues</hi> after <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> ſhall find <hi>God</hi> nearer to him, than he is to himſelf. God hath not <hi>forſaken</hi> the earth; but as he ſuſtains the <hi>whole univerſe,</hi> much more <hi>thoſe</hi> who are ſeeking grace and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Are you then ſtriving to be godly, and aiming at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life? His almighty arms will bear you up, and he'l che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh you with his own goodneſs. Whereſoever God beholds any breathings after himſelf, he gives life to them, as thoſe which are his own breath in them: where there is any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſober reſolution againſt ſin, any real motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, there's the bleſſing of heaven in it. He that <hi>planted</hi> it, will alſo <hi>water</hi> it, and make it to <hi>bud</hi> and <hi>bloſſom,</hi> and bring forth fruit.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But a godly life is an afflicted life.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="361" facs="tcp:55699:140"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You have heard that <hi>grace</hi> in us is the life of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> in us. We ought then to know what his life was.</p>
            <p>The life of Jeſus is, <hi>Divinely Humane,</hi> and <hi>Humanely Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine:</hi> he is <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and therefore lives a life <hi>Divine,</hi> and a life <hi>Humane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>God,</hi> he lives the life of God in the boſom of his Father; a life of Glory, Power, and Majeſty.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Man,</hi> he lived the life of Man in lowneſs, humiliation, in impotence, in ſufferings; ſo that at the ſame, he is <hi>living</hi> in the boſom of his Father, and <hi>dying</hi> on the arms of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There</hi> he reigns and governs, and judges all the world; <hi>here</hi> he is accuſed, and accurſed, condemned and crucified; at the ſame inſtant, he is in the exaltation and greatneſs of his Majeſty, and in the lowneſs and humiliation of our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
            <p>Such alſo ought the <hi>Chriſtian life</hi> to be: on the one ſide it is <hi>great,</hi> ſeeing grace makes us the Children of God, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates and unites us to God. On the other ſide the ſame life is obſcured, dejected wholly in the ſpirit of humiliations and privations: for grace cannot reign in the ſoul without ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating therein annihilation, death, and humility.</p>

               <hi>up, and made to ſit in heavenly places in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And at the ſame time the life of a Chriſtian is expoſed here to Temptations, derided by men, and condemned by the world; at the ſame time it is in the <hi>greateſt cheriſhing</hi> of God, and under the <hi>fierceſt agitation</hi> of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>So that an <hi>afflicted godly life</hi> ſhould be no wonder, being compared with the life of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Beſides, God <hi>enlightens</hi> the ſoul by grace; 'tis granted, but 'tis in <hi>annihilation,</hi> he <hi>upholds</hi> her, but 'tis in <hi>confounding</hi> her; he <hi>unites</hi> her to him, but it is in <hi>ſeparating</hi> her ſometimes from himſelf: and ſhe remains ſeparated from God, as long as ſhe remains upon earth. <hi>While we are in the body, we are abſent from the Lord;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 6.</note> ſo ſhe is at once <hi>united</hi> and <hi>ſeparated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, This is the Conduct of God over his <hi>Church.</hi> If we reflect upon the <hi>higheſt</hi> works, we ſhall find he puts not on the Ornament of Grace, he lays not the foundation of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:55699:141"/> her eſtate, but in lowneſs, his grace, his gifts, his ſpirit, and his communications. When did he come down from heaven, and give her his law, with ſuch appearance of <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſty,</hi> as never the like was, but when he had brought her into a <hi>wilderneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Lord Chriſt inſtituted the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which are <hi>Conduit-pipes</hi> to convey his graces to his Church, he choſe <hi>bread, water,</hi> ſuch things as are mean, little or nothing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed among men.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Birth</hi> of the Church, he took the <hi>Croſs</hi> for the <hi>Throne</hi> of his <hi>Empire,</hi> a <hi>Calvary</hi> for his <hi>Seat-Royal;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected an <hi>eſtate</hi> by <hi>Poverty, Sufferings,</hi> and <hi>Martyrdom:</hi> and at this day he doth the ſame in the <hi>Regency</hi> of his Church.</p>
            <p>And according to Gods proceedings in the Conduct of his <hi>Church,</hi> is likewiſe his carriage in the ſanctification and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>ſouls;</hi> he leads them by the Croſs, he retires from them, he hides himſelf, he leaves them in privations, he humbles them, annihilates them, ſmites them, overthrows them.</p>
            <p>Whereby is diſcovered, how they are (as I think) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, who in their devotions and religious exerciſes ſeek reſentments, enjoyments, content and ſatisfaction, and would know and feel the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>elevations</hi> of grace; I call it a deceit (as I ſuppoſe) for <hi>Chriſtian grace</hi> conſiſts chiefly in privations, in lowneſs, in rigours, and that is it they ſtand moſt in fear of, and avoid.</p>
            <p>But as the life of Jeſus began in <hi>poverty,</hi> and ended on the <hi>Croſs;</hi> ſo a <hi>perfect Chriſtian,</hi> who would live a life of grace, muſt reſolve to walk among <hi>Thorns,</hi> to bear priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſuſtain deſertions; for the <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> are things proper to <hi>Chriſtian-grace,</hi> and to the <hi>love</hi> of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us not ſo much ſeek after aſſurance of heaven as a thing to come, as after heaven it ſelf preſent in us.</hi> For where <hi>Heaven</hi> comes into a heart, it will bring its own light, comfort, and aſſurance along with it. Get <hi>Heaven</hi> into your ſoul, and you will eaſily have the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <pb n="363" facs="tcp:55699:141"/>
            <p>Let us have a fire in a room, and we ſhall quickly have the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>warmth</hi> of it there alſo.</p>
            <p>Men ſeek the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of Heaven as a thing <hi>to come,</hi> but neglect the <hi>preſent</hi> power and poſſeſſion of Heaven it ſelf in their ſouls. Oh! let us get the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf into us, and then we ſhall not be without its <hi>ſhine</hi> and <hi>ſmiles</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us.</p>
